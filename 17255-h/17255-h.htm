July 18th.</p>
<p><em>Dear and Beloved Constance</em>,&mdash;What shall I say to
you? Here I sit, in a strange room, in a strange land,&mdash;and my
life lies behind me. It is close upon midnight, and very dark. I
can see nothing out of window. The air is hot and heavy, the moths
flutter round my candle; I cannot save them all. I am trying to
write you a letter&mdash;do you understand? Oh, but I have no
thoughts, only visions! Three there are that rise before me,
sometimes separately, sometimes all together.</p>
<p>I see you, Mrs. Norris. We are standing on the platform, side by
side; people leaning out of window in my night-gown, watching the
mists rise in the valley. The air is very sweet here in England; I
see oceans of trees, great stretches of heath and meadow. Surely,
surely one ought to be happy in this beautiful world! I shall dress
quickly and go out. This letter, such as it is, shall go to you by
the first post, and to-night I shall write again, when I myself
know something of my surroundings. Good-bye then for the present,
my best and dearest.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER II.</h3>
<p class="address">July 19.</p>
<p>It is just half-past ten, my Constance; the two old ladies have
gone to bed. I am getting on very well, on the whole, although I
had the misfortune to keep them waiting three-quarters of an hour
for breakfast this morning. It was so beautiful out of doors, and I
was so happy roaming in field and wood,&mdash;happy with the
happiness sunshine can lay atop of the greatest sorrow,&mdash;that
I stayed out till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock. I had taken some milk
and bread in the kitchen before starting, not realising that
breakfast here is a solemn meal. Poor old souls! they were too
polite to begin without me, and I found them positively drooping
with hunger.</p>
<p>All the rancour that I had harboured in my heart this many a
year against my father&rsquo;s stepmother has vanished into thin
air. One glance at the old lady&rsquo;s delicate weak face, at her
diffident eyes and nervous fingers, dispelled once and forever any
preconceived idea that she might have helped him in his ardent
difficult boyhood, stood between him and his father in his day of
disgrace. Had she been a woman of mettle, I could never have
forgiven her the neutral part she played; but she stands there
cleared by her very impotence.</p>
<p>I think she was nervous of meeting me, last night; she said
something confused about my poor papa, about her husband&rsquo;s
severity, adding that she was sorry not to have known my mamma, but
supposed I must be like her, as I looked quite the foreigner with
my black eyes. Her whole manner towards me is almost painful in its
humility; this morning she begged me to let her live with me, and
die in this house, saying she did not care to go and live with her
son; upon which I of course assured her that she must still
consider everything her own, and the scene ended in kisses and a
pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>There is something very touching about an old woman&rsquo;s
hand; I felt myself much more moved than the occasion warranted
when she held me with her trembling fingers, moving them nervously
up and down, so that I felt the small weak bones under the skin,
all soft, full-veined, and wrinkled.</p>
<p>Her sister, Caroline Seymour, is younger, probably not more than
sixty, and very active. She has a bright, bird-like face, over
which flits from time to time a sad little gleam of lost beauty.
Her fingers are always busy, and the beads in her cap bob up and
down incessantly as she bends over her fancy-work. Poor old
souls&mdash;poor old children! I think my grandfather must have led
them a life; there is a peacefulness upon them that suggests
deliverance. He has been dead just five weeks.</p>
<p>But the old house will see quiet days enough now. I have
wandered all over it, and find it a beautiful place in itself,
although it is so stuffed with wool-work, vile china, gildings, wax
flowers, and indescribable mantel-piece atrocities, that there is
not a simple or restful corner anywhere. Yet I find myself touched
by its very hideousness, when I think that it probably looked even
so, smelt even so stale and sweet, in the days of my dear
father&rsquo;s boyhood. There is a picture in the large
drawing-room that gives me infinite pleasure. It is a portrait of
my own grandmother with papa in a white frock on her knees, and my
poor Aunt Fanny beside her, a neat little smiling girl in pink,
with very long drawers. There is something in the young
mother&rsquo;s face that, at first sight, made my father&rsquo;s
smile rise clearly to my memory. I have since tried to recall the
vision, but in vain.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s half-brother, George Fletcher, a widower with
a large family, who lives four miles from here, came to see me this
afternoon, and I took a great dislike to him. (Did I hear you say
&ldquo;Of course&rdquo;?) But really, dearest, these introductions
are very painful; it is most unpleasant to have the undesirable
stranger thrust upon one in the guise of friend and protector, to
find oneself standing on a footing of inevitable familiarity with
people whose hands one had rather not touch. He kissed me,
Constantia, but he certainly will not do so again. Fortunately, I
like my two old ladies; things might be worse.</p>
<p>To-morrow my lawyer comes from London to speak to me on
business. I shall be glad when the interview is over, for I
understand nothing at all about business matters. I can indeed
barely grasp the fact that I have come into possession of land and
money. Heaven only knows what I am to do with it all.</p>
<p>Write to me; write soon. You seem further away from me to-day
than you did last night; and yet I should miss you more if I could
realise my own existence. Can you make your way through these
contradictions? It seems to me this evening that I, Emilia, am
still beside you, that some one else sits here in exile with
nothing written on the page of her future, not even by the finger
of Hope. Good night, dearest.</p>
<p class="signature">Yours ever and always,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER III.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Fletcher&rsquo;s Hall,
Graysmill</span>,<br />
July 26th.</p>
<p>What do you think stepped in with my bath this morning? A long
narrow letter sealed with a heart. I kissed the blue stamp and
spread the three dear sheets out on my pillow. Oim&eacute;,
Constantia, how I love you! But why write about <em>me</em>? Why
waste pen and ink wondering how I am? Tell me about yourself, tell
me all you do, and all you think; tell me how many different hats
you wore on Wednesday, and how you misspent your time on Thursday;
tell me of all the nonsense that is poured into your ears, of all
the rubbish you read; tell me even how many times your mother wakes
you in the night to ask if you are sleeping well. I long for you so
that the very faults of your life are dear to me, even those for
which I most reprove you when you are near.</p>
<p>Let me see: it is past midday with you; you and your mother are
out walking. I hear you both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance,&rdquo; says Mrs. Rayner, &ldquo;put up your
parasol!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, mother,&rdquo; you reply; &ldquo;I like to feel
the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll freckle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this thick veil and all the powder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll freckle, I tell you. Put up your
parasol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, do let me be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Rayner wrenches the parasol out of your hands and puts
it up with a jerk; you take it, heaving a very loud sigh, upon
which your mother seizes it again and pops it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, be as freckled as you please; what does it
matter to me, after all? It&rsquo;s so pretty to have freckles,
isn&rsquo;t it? Please yourself! Only I warn you that you&rsquo;ll
look like a fig before the year&rsquo;s out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, dear me, it seems I&rsquo;m in good spirits to-day! Why not,
with your letter in my pocket? I am sitting out of doors in the
woods. I love this place, apart from its own beauty; I like to
think of my father out here in the open, dreaming his young dreams.
Indoors in the old house I am often miserable, with a misery beyond
my own, remembering how he suffered once between those walls.</p>
<p>No, I am not really in good spirits, although there comes now
and again a little gust of light-heartedness. You know me. For the
rest, I hate myself, I am a worm. The empire of myself is lost; I
am sitting low on the ground, where my troubles laid me, letting
what may run over me. I hate myself both for my abject hopelessness
and for my incapacity to take comfort at the hands of those about
me. But oh! the deadliness of their life is past description; they
have neither breadth nor health in their thoughts. I am not
speaking of the old women; their lives are at an end; they sit as
little children there, simple of heart; what they were I ask not,
nor boots it now, for their day is done. But George Fletcher and
his family, and my various more distant relatives, and my
neighbours far and near&mdash;oh, I shall never be able to live
here! Believe me; you will soon see me back. Good people, mind you,
one and all, according to their lights; God-fearing, law-abiding,
nothing questioning, one and all. I shall soon expect to see the
earth stand still and roll backwards. Yes; there they trot upon
life&rsquo;s highway, chained together, dragging each other along;
not one of them dares stop to pick a flower lest the others should
tread on his fingers and toes. And they are so swaddled up in
customs and conventions, baby-learned forms of speech and bearing,
that there is nothing to be seen of the real man and woman; indeed,
I cannot say that I have yet found a mummy worth unrolling.
Yesterday a kind of cousin brought her children to see me. There
was a small girl who had already learned, poor wretch, to play her
little part, to quell the impulses of her young heart, to tune her
tongue to a given pitch. She sat on the edge of her chair, feigning
indifference to everything, from Chinese chessmen to
gingerbread-nuts; it was a positive relief to me when her younger
brother, who has not yet learned the most necessary falsehoods,
yelled lustily and smashed a tea-cup. I should have been glad to do
both myself.</p>
<p>I must unpack my books. A Broadwood is on its way from London;
in a few days I hope to have made unto myself some kind of oasis in
this desert. I have taken possession of the two rooms on the
topmost floor that were my father&rsquo;s nurseries; and there,
with my things about me, I mean to be happy against all odds.</p>
<p>Good-bye for to-day. Do you remember this morning a fortnight
ago? It might be last year&mdash;it might be yesterday! How strange
is the beat of Time&rsquo;s wings!</p>
<p class="signature">Your <span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER IV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, August
2d.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s the kind of letter I like to have! Only my
heart sickens for thee. At each word I hear your voice; at every
pause, the little ripples that run away with it so sweetly. I
cannot even find it in me to scold you for your many follies. Young
woman, I don&rsquo;t approve of you, but you are the sweetest
creature that ever walked this earth. Thanks be where thanks are
due that I am a woman; you would have been my bane had I been born
a man!</p>
<p>But, to be serious, I have been thinking things out; you must
leave your mother, Constance, and come to me. You have lived this
kind of life long enough; and&mdash;believe me, my
dearest&mdash;you are not strong enough to bear it longer
unharmed.</p>
<p>Shall I be a little cruel to you? Well, my own, I think that if
you looked into your heart, searchingly and truly, as you always
declare you know not how, you would find that it is more cowardice
than duty binds you to Mrs. Rayner. She bore you, you say, she
brought you up&mdash;Good Lord! and how! If you were not a pearl
among women, what would you be by this time? No, you know as well
as I do that it is cowardice, not duty, prevents you from taking
this step.</p>
<p>I shall never forget what you said to me once, when first I knew
you; it was in Florence, and we were leaning out of window in my
room. I remember it the better because it was during this
conversation that I ventured to put my arm round your waist for the
first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I call this pleasant!&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Here am
I looking out of window with a nice girl&rsquo;s arm round my
waist, and right away from my mother. She doesn&rsquo;t even know
where I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I loved my mother so much that this shocked me extremely, and I
told you so. You flushed, I remember, and cried:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you don&rsquo;t know what my life is! You
don&rsquo;t know what it is to long with all your might to get away
from somebody, somebody who has hung over you ever since you were
born, so that she seemed to stand between you and the very air you
breathed.&rdquo; And then you told me about your marriage; how, in
order to be free from her, you took the husband, rich and infamous,
into whose arms she threw you in your innocence; how, at the end of
a few months, you returned home doubly a slave, to be crushed, year
in, year out, by love that showed itself almost as hate; bound now
in such a way that if any other love were offered you, you could
not take it.</p>
<p>And how old are you now? Twenty-four. Still her puppet, her
doll, for that is what you are; she dresses and undresses you from
morning till night, then struts up and down the streets of Europe,
showing her pretty plaything. You say she has no thought but you,
loves you so much that it would break her heart if you left her.
Look here, Constance: you knew my mother; you know then what it
means to live nobly and truly in the light of a greater goodness
than the world yet understands. God, or whoever made you, made your
soul very white; how dare you let the smuts fall upon it? How dare
you tread among falsehoods, you that have heard of Truth?</p>
<p>Try, my dearest, try to be brave; surely it is the duty of each
one of us to live the noblest life he can. The world is so
beautiful! It is only ourselves and our mistakes that lie foul upon
it. When the most holy of human ties, defying nature, becomes the
bane of those it binds, it is better to break it than to let
one&rsquo;s life cast a daily blot, as it were, on the sanctity of
motherhood and the love of the child.</p>
<p>Come to me; live with me in peace awhile! We will think and read
together, master ourselves, and find some path to tread. I, too, am
in need of resolution. Whilst my dear mother lived, she held me by
the hand. You know how, when two walk together, the weaker
unconsciously leaves it to the stronger to lead the way? Well, so
it was with me; and now I must learn to find my path alone. I know
now what she meant when she said that the first use to which a man
must put his courage is to being himself.</p>
<p>All good be with you, dear heart.</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER V.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, August
7th.</p>
<p>Dearest, I wrote you such a stern letter the other day, that I
feel I must write again before the week comes round. It was, after
all, a silly promise we made each other to write just once a week,
neither more nor less. This time I write at odds with myself.
It&rsquo;s all very well to talk about sincerity, it baffles one
completely at times; there isn&rsquo;t a greater liar under the sun
at this moment than Emilia Fletcher. My outward life is all out of
tune with my inward self. Perhaps if you saw me with my old ladies,
you would say: &ldquo;Quite right; please them by all means, sit
with them, drive with them, make small talk, listen to their little
tales. It pleases them, and it doesn&rsquo;t harm you.&rdquo; But I
answer: Is it right? Is it not rank hypocrisy? Is affection won by
false pretences worth the having? I tell you, I am playing a part
all day long. I read to them out of books that I either despise or
abhor; I play to them music unworthy of the name; I nod my head in
acquiescence when my very soul cries no. Nor is that all; I take my
place each morning in the centre of the room, open the Bible, and
in pious voice, I, Infidel, read forth the prayers that are to
strengthen the household through the day. When, at a given point,
all the maid-servants rise, whirl round in their calico gowns and
turn their demure backs to me as they kneel in a row, I know not
whether to laugh or cry. O Constance, it is infamous of me! And why
do I do it? Out of consideration for them? out of kind-heartedness?
Not a bit of it! Vanity, my dear; sheer vanity. If they cared for
me less, if I did not feel that they almost worship me, holding out
their old hands to me for all the pleasure that their day still may
bring, would I do it? No; for then I should not care, as I feel I
do now, to keep their good opinion, even at the expense of making
myself appear better, according to their lights, than I really am.
I am a worm; I never thought I could sink so low. It was so easy to
live in tune with Truth beside my mother; but she was Truth&rsquo;s
high-priestess; she never swerved from the straight path.</p>
<p>I went to church last Sunday; there&rsquo;s a confession!
Another such act of cowardice, and I am lost. It never entered my
head, of course, to go the first Sunday I was here; and as it so
happened that I had a headache that day, no comment was made upon
my absence. But on Saturday the vicar said something about
&ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo;; Uncle George invited himself to dinner
after service; and when Aunt Caroline asked me, at breakfast on
Sunday, what hat I was going to put on, I replied, &ldquo;The small
one,&rdquo; and followed her like a lamb. I don&rsquo;t know what
to do now. This afternoon, the good little old lady asked me to
call with her on a friend whose father died last week, and I went,
Heaven knows why. I was well served out. There they sat a mortal
hour, blowing their noses and praising their God, until I could
have shrieked. When I had safely seen Aunt Caroline home, I set off
for a long walk in the gloaming; the silent earth was stretched in
peace beneath the deepening sky, the moon rose among great clouds
that floated like dragons&rsquo; ghosts upon the blue. And I cried
out within myself for very pain that I who had perception of these
things should live so lying and so false a life. Perhaps I am not
quite myself yet; so much sorrow came to me at once that all my
strength has left me. But it is cowardly to make excuses.</p>
<p>I hear you: &ldquo;There you go, old wise-bones! Here&rsquo;s a
storm in a tea-cup! It&rsquo;s much better to behave properly
<em>out</em>side anyway, than to hurt people&rsquo;s feelings and
make them think worse of you than they need, by showing them what a
wicked infidel you are. Besides, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little one, do you remember how we shocked each other that
Christmas morning in Florence, when we made a round of the churches
together? I can see you still, you pretty thing, crossing yourself
at the door of Santa Maria Novella. With all the strictness of my
nineteen years I was simply horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constance!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what on earth are you
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be left in the cold,&rdquo; you
replied; &ldquo;if there are any blessings going, I may as well
have my share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dearest,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
believe in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t, but it may be true, for all
that; how do we know? Do let me enjoy myself, you dear old granny!
The stale water may not do me any good, but it won&rsquo;t do me
any harm either, now will it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, dear, how the smell of the church comes back with the
remembered words! It was a long time ago. Dear and sweet one, I
must not think of you too much, I long for you so.</p>
<p class="signature">Yours in endless love,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER VI.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Fletcher&rsquo;s Hall</span>,
August 12th.</p>
<p>You must do as you think best. You know that I long for you,
that the thought of your wasted life is constant pain to me. Think
again, think every day, and if ever you can make up your mind to
leave Mrs. Rayner, you know that I am here, that all I have is
yours also. I shall say no more.</p>
<p>So you have seen him, and he asked after me. Well. What was he
doing in Homburg, I wonder? Not that I care. I really believe,
Constance, that I care no longer. And yet it so happens that last
night I thought of him a good deal. It came about so. Grandmamma
had gone to bed, and I went into Aunt Caroline&rsquo;s room to
light her candles. There are some little water-colours round the
mirror that she painted as a girl. I stopped to look at them, and
the poor soul took them down one by one to show me. There was a
story attached to each, and her eyes brightened with remembrance of
the past. Most of the little pictures were different views of the
same house. Suddenly she gave a little smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute; I&rsquo;ll show you another picture,
Milly&mdash;my best picture.&rdquo; (They will call me Milly;
there&rsquo;s no help for it.) &ldquo;I have never shown it to any
one before, but you are a good girl; I think I should like to show
it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cleared a space upon her dressing-table, lighted a third
candle, a fourth, making a little illumination; then from her
wardrobe she brought an old desk, and unlocked it solemnly with a
key that always hangs upon her watch-chain. The desk was full of
treasures,&mdash;letters, flowers, ends of ribbon, all neatly
labelled. She opened a little case and placed in my hands the
portrait of a young man.</p>
<p>I hardly knew how to take it. &ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;what a handsome face!&rdquo; Then the veil of silence
and old age fell from her heart; she told me the whole tale.
Nothing new, of course. She had loved, and&mdash;strange to
say!&mdash;the man had done likewise; they were engaged, but
because his family was not equal to hers in birth, her
brother-in-law, my grandfather, would not hear of the match, and
obliged her to break it off. Yet another sin to add to his
score!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you should have
married him, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman blew her nose, rose, and kissed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the first that ever told me so,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;I think so, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was past midnight when I left her, and I must confess that my
own eyes were not dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still alive?&rdquo; I asked, as I reached the
door.</p>
<p>The old woman smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I shall
know in good time; please God we shall soon meet again in a better
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay awake a long time in the night, marvelling at her
constancy and her faith. But then I wept to think how many women,
even as she, have held one only flower in their hands, clung to it
still when colour and scent were gone, refusing to pluck another;
wept, too, to think how many such as she are buoyed up by a hope I
cannot share. I wonder what it feels like, this implicit faith in
an after life! It must make a difference, even in love. Perhaps we
who believe in one life only cling with the greater passion to what
we love, seeing that, once lost, we have no hope of
re-possession.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a sad world. But a funny one, too. I was quite
shy of meeting Aunt Caroline again this morning, lest the
remembrance of what she had told me over-night should make her feel
ill at ease; lest, in fact, she had repented of her confidence. And
I stood quite a while outside the breakfast-room door, like a fool.
But as I entered, her beaded cap was bobbing over an uplifted
dish-cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good morning, Milly!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No,
sister, it&rsquo;s not Upton&rsquo;s fault. The bacon&rsquo;s
beautiful, only cook can&rsquo;t cut a rasher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again I was in my common dilemma; I didn&rsquo;t know
whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Good-bye, sweetest; take care of yourself.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER VII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, August
20th.</p>
<p>Good evening, Mrs. Norris. I am in a very good temper,&mdash;and
you? (N.B. I had an extra letter this morning; somebody spoils
me.)</p>
<p>Now what shall I tell you, Inquisitiveness? Indeed, I tell you
all there is to tell. You complain that I never speak about the
people I meet; that&rsquo;s true enough. When I find myself in
their company, I make the best of it, but I never think about them
between whiles. As for Uncle George, why, I dislike him thoroughly.
He is handsome in his way, and looks remarkably young,&mdash;not
that that is exactly a crime! One of my principal objections to his
person is a kind of bachelor smartness he carries about with him.
It is quite ridiculous to see him with his daughters, the eldest of
whom is just eighteen and engaged to be married. There is nothing
of the simplicity of the country gentleman about him,&mdash;a
simplicity that in many cases covers a multitude of faults. No, I
shall never be able to bear him,&mdash;neither his juvenility, his
jewelry, nor his whiskers&mdash;certainly never the scent on his
handkerchief! Ouf! I hate him altogether. I promise you that when I
find a human being with whom I can exchange an idea, whose thoughts
have even wandered half a mile beyond the parish, I shall apprize
you of the fact. Meanwhile, dearest, you must put up with my
company, as I myself am learning to do. It seems to me almost that
I need no one else! I sit here in my room, out there in the woods,
and I am content. I read a great deal; I have just re-read the
&ldquo;Volsunga Saga,&rdquo; and have begun Tolstoi&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cossacks.&rdquo; I am trying, too, to continue my
mother&rsquo;s translation of &ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; but the
difference between my work and hers is so great that I sometimes
lose heart. However, I shall try to finish it. Her beautiful face
and yours look down at me from the shelf above my writing-table,
amidst a wealth of flowers; and, as I look up, I can see the sun
setting behind the beech-trees, for I sit beside the window. The
sky is full of hope, the little clouds are glowing with colour, the
trees with fulness of life; a blackbird is singing his heart out in
the willow by the pond. I must needs believe that life is worth
living&hellip;.</p>
<p>I have watched all the pink fade from the sky; the mottled
clouds are grey and sleepy-looking. I have turned away. You are
smiling very sweetly up there; my table is strewn with things her
hand has touched,&mdash;I am not quite alone.</p>
<p>Well, good night. I must go down to my dear old ladies and read
to them a while before they go to bed.</p>
<p class="signature">Your <span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER VIII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, September
4th.</p>
<p>You are a sweet to write so often, and I am a wretched niggard
that deserves not one half of what you give. I began to write
several times&mdash;of course you know that. Take care of yourself;
the thought of your coughing troubles me; each time I think of you
I hear you cough, and it makes me miserable. I met a child on the
Common yesterday, with hair your colour that fell back in thick
curls from a forehead almost as white as yours. Need I say that I
kissed her? Poor mite, she had such dirty clothes! She told me
where she lives; I must make inquiries about her mother. I might be
able to help. The existence of poverty is just beginning to dawn
upon me. It is strange how long one can live with one&rsquo;s eyes
entirely closed to certain things. In Italy I never thought about
it; I sometimes felt sorry for a beggar, but never quite believed
in poverty as an actual state; it merely seemed a rather
disreputable but picturesque profession. Here in England I have
come face to face with destitution; with hunger, labour, sweat, and
barren joylessness. My first thought was that money might set all
this straight; I made Uncle George laugh by seriously suggesting
that I should give of my superfluity to every cottage. Most people
here visit the poor; I went with Aunt Caroline at first and saw it
all. I soon gave it up. I cannot walk boldly into free human
beings&rsquo; homes and poke my nose into their privacy; I cannot
speak to them of the Lord&rsquo;s will and persuade them that all
is for the best. I can only give them money. Little Mrs. Dobb, the
rector&rsquo;s wife, thanked me with tears in her eyes for a sum I
placed in her hands yesterday. They say she does a great deal of
good, and if my money and her religion can work together, by all
means let it be so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I ask myself every day: What is the use of Emilia
Fletcher? I really cannot see why I ever was born; my perceptions
are keen, but keener than my capabilities. I shall never be able to
do anything to help the world; yet I see so much that might be
done. I shall not ever be able to lead that life of simple truth,
of absolute fidelity to high-set aims, which I yet believe it must
be in every man&rsquo;s power to live. Which is the more to be
despised&mdash;he who perceives a higher path and lacks the
resolution to adhere to it, or he who trots along the common road
out of sheer short-sightedness? Clearly the first. I am a worm.
(You have probably heard this before.)</p>
<p>Well, I am not a very gay companion; I shall leave you for
to-day, sweetest.</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER IX.</h3>
<p class="address">Sunday evening.</p>
<p>I have made a fool of myself; and yet I am happier to-night than
I have been this many a day, for I have at least shown myself
honest. I did it foolishly, thoughtlessly, I know, and
yet,&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p>I went to church this morning for the last time. I went with
Aunt Caroline, as usual, but, as I knelt beside her on entering the
pew, I was seized with a great horror of myself. There was I,
hypocrite, with silent lips and silent heart, feigning to share in
the simple fervour around me, denying my own faith, insulting that
of another. However, I sat and knelt and stood and went through all
the forms along with the rest. The sunlight streamed in at the
windows, and lay coloured on the dusty floor, on bowed head and
Sunday bonnet; through one little white window, just opposite me, I
could see a sparrow bobbing up and down on the ivy. Then away
sailed my spirit, through the church wall, over the meadows, and
into the copse; I pushed my way through the underwood, and picked
up a leaf here and there, listening to the gentle voice of the
wood-pigeon. And then&mdash;you know there is one thought into
which all thoughts resolve&mdash;I walked with you, dearest, on the
hilltops by Fiesole; she, too, was there, and you both laughed at
me because I tried to dig up a wild orchid with a flint, and got my
hands so dirty.</p>
<p>Then we had that long talk about the possibility of an
after-life, which began with the bulb of the orchid&mdash;do you
remember?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is lost in Nature,&rdquo; said my mother.
&ldquo;There is no such thing as annihilation; death is surely
transubstantiation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps then, after all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the
noblest part of us, the self, that invisible core which we call
soul, is just a drop, as it were, in a great soul-ocean, whose
waves wrap creation, and into which we shall fall. What&rsquo;s the
matter, Constantia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t listen to you any more, you prosy things;
you make me melancholy. Go and be waves if you like, you two;
I&rsquo;m going to have white wings and be an angel!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>&ldquo;I believe in God Almighty, Maker of Heaven and
Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words roused me with a hard and sudden shock. I had
completely forgotten where I was; I looked about me, half dazed,
and saw everyone standing except myself. Must I, too, rise and say
the Creed? I did not hesitate, because I did not think. I simply
stood up and left the church.</p>
<p>After dinner I went to the rectory; I felt that my former
hypocrisy and cowardice must be atoned for without delay. Besides,
as Goethe&rsquo;s mother used to say, there is no need to stare at
the devil, it is better to swallow him whole. Well, I went to Mr.
Dobb, and confessed myself. He was less shocked at my disbelief
than I had expected, but my profession of it troubled him
considerably. He spoke a great deal about example, about the
leading of the masses, and altogether seems to hold avowed lack of
faith, a greater sin than feigned belief.</p>
<p>Of course he had plenty to say on the subject; he seems to be an
honest man, and I must admit that much of what I heard impressed
me. I envied him the ease with which he spoke, the ready-coined
language he was free to use. I could find no words in which to
prove that I, too, had a religion. I wonder, shall I ever be able
to tell another what it is that I feel, as by means of a sixth
sense, when earth and heaven are fairest, when poets sing their
best and music is most divine, when the souls of men and women leap
to their eyes and their hearts lie bare; then something within me
smiles and shivers, and I say, &ldquo;This&mdash;this is
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, it is all very well to talk of being sincere! Again and yet
again I must say it. For the lips cannot speak what the spirit
feels. And then,&mdash;why, I spoiled my truthful day by a lie at
the end. How could I go to those two old dears and say, &ldquo;I
cannot pray with you or go to church any more, I am an
infidel.&rdquo; How could I? I said instead, &ldquo;My mother
brought me up in a different faith; I tried to go to your church,
but I cannot, and I think you would not wish me to act against my
conscience in so sacred a matter, so we will go our
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, what a struggling world it is! And how weary one becomes of
the incessant strife when those upon whose hearts one might lean
are far away, unknown, or dead! Oh, I am very lonely. What is life
without love? It is not to be borne. Do you remember what it was to
lie in your cot, to watch the firelight on the ceiling, feeling the
darkness without; and, as you lay snug in your little world within
the world, to see your mother lean over your pillow, a great
Heaven-roof of love,&mdash;to be lifted, weak and small and
trustful, in her arms, to feel your weary head pressed close
against her breast? O Constance, I would give all&mdash;my very
eyesight&mdash;to feel an arm about me in the dark, to yield up
Self, to rest. We women are poor wretches; no man would ever feel
so, I think.</p>
<p>Good night; my candle has burned low in the socket, the paper is
flaring already, I shall have to undress in the dark.</p>
<p class="signature">Good night, dearest.<br />

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER X.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, September
20th.</p>
<p>Blessings upon you, my sweet dearest; your birthday is the day
of days to me. How could I live without you? I am purely selfish
when I wish you perfect joy and a long golden life; it is almost
like praying for fine weather! All the strings of my heart go
towards you, Constance Norris, and are knotted in your bosom. Be
happy, be well, my darling, else I suffer. We shall not be apart on
your next birthday, I think. I have evolved a marvellous scheme.
Your mother is still young, and a very handsome woman; why
don&rsquo;t you marry her? Really, it&rsquo;s a plan worth
attempting; couldn&rsquo;t you persuade one of your numerous
admirers to transfer his affections? Then, Constantia mia, we two
could live together. We should mostly live abroad, following the
sunshine; but for a part of the year we should stay here in
England. Don&rsquo;t wrinkle up your dear nose! You will be every
bit as much in love with the country as I am, when once you know it
well. I wish I could show it you now; the woods are changing
colour, &lsquo;tis a glowing world, and your lungs have never
tasted such air as blows on Graysmill Heath. You would be very
happy in the woods in summer; you could lie down and bring your
face on a level with the flowers, and I should sit by and love you.
There would be little sunbeams piercing the roof of leaves and
twinkling about us, and just enough breeze to clear your brow of
curls. O Constance! Why are we so far apart? Only one life, and
then parted! But one must not think of such things.</p>
<p>I send you a little ring that I found the other day in
Miltonhoe; there is a kiss on the red stone, don&rsquo;t lose
it.</p>
<p>Blessings upon you, my heart of gold.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XI.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, October
5th.</p>
<p>Three several times have I begun to write to you, but I came to
the conclusion that it is better not to write at all than to give
vent to such feelings as mine. Besides, I had nothing, positively
nothing, to tell you. Furthermore, you did not deserve a letter.
However, as it is all too long since you honoured me with a
communication, Mrs. Norris, I feel I must write and remind you of
my existence. I am well, thank you, but the world&rsquo;s a dull
place.</p>
<p>Grandmamma and Aunt Caroline&mdash;perhaps myself, who
knows?&mdash;are in a great state of excitement to-day because a
niece of theirs is coming here on a visit. I heard of her existence
for the first time last week, and immediately decided to invite her
to Fletcher&rsquo;s Hall. For, Constance, let me whisper it, the
old ladies&mdash;bless their hearts!&mdash;are killing me. This
person, Ida Seymour by name, is a spinster of some forty winters, a
kind of roving, charitable star, from what I gather, who spends her
life visiting from place to place with a trunkful of fancy work,
pious books, and innocent sources of amusement,&mdash;a fairy
godmother to old ladies, pauper children, and bazaars. My vanity
has run its course, and I shall gladly yield the place of honour to
this worthy soul. May she stay long!</p>
<p>That is absolutely all the news I have for you, and, indeed, it
is more than you deserve; for you are about as lazy as you are
sweet, which is saying a good deal. If I don&rsquo;t get a letter
to-morrow, I shall be on the brink of despair. At the approach of
post time, I am nearly ill with anticipation, and afterwards fall
headlong into deepest melancholy.</p>
<p class="signature">Your ill-used<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, October
10th.</p>
<p>Sweet, your letter of Thursday comforted me wondrous much; but I
have something to tell you, and my impatience will not even let me
dwell on the joy it was to read words of yours again. Well;
yesterday was a dull day, the sky was covered all the morning, and
at dinner-time it began to rain. I sat in my room in the afternoon
and read &ldquo;Richard Feverel&rdquo; until, looking up from my
book, I saw that the rain had ceased. The wind had risen, and, in
the west, a hole had been poked through the grey mantle, showing
the gilded edge of a snowy cloud against a patch of blue. Out I
ran, across the garden and the little park that touches the heath,
then through my dear beechwood until I reached a certain clearing
where the ground goes sheer down at one&rsquo;s feet and where one
may behold, over the tree-tops, stretches of wood and meadow in the
plain below. I sprang on to a knoll, and there stood breathless,
watching the rout of the tumbled clouds.</p>
<p>Something started beside me,&mdash;I started also, for these
woods are always very lonely,&mdash;and, to my surprise, I saw a
young man. Imagine a very tall slight fellow, carelessly dressed,
at one and the same time graceful and ungainly,&mdash;I have come
to the conclusion that he is physically graceful, but that a
certain shyness and nervousness of temperament produce at times
self-consciousness and awkwardness of bearing. It is difficult to
describe his face; I don&rsquo;t know whether he is merely
interesting or actually beautiful; here again there is some
discrepancy between flesh and spirit, for the features are not
regular, but the expression exquisite. I suppose he might be
considered plain; his nose is large, rather thin, and not straight;
his mouth is large but finely shaped; I think he smiles a little
crookedly. Anyway, his eyes are beautiful; they are set far apart,
and are strangely expressive. For the rest, he is more freckled
than any one I ever saw, and his hair&mdash;which is of no
particular colour&mdash;is rather long and thrown off the temples,
save for one lock that continually falls forward. You will think I
am in love with the apparition, to judge by the way in which I
dwell on his description; indeed, I am almost inclined to think so
myself!</p>
<p>Well! I stood and stared at him; his hat was off, an open book
was in his hand, and he gazed at me as one not well awake, that has
been roused from dreams; with something in his looks, too, of the
startled animal that would run away and dare not. There is no
knowing how long we might have stood there staring at each other,
but for a sudden gust of wind that whisked off my hat, whereupon
the young man and I both started downhill in pursuit. The wind was
playful, and led us a fine dance; we were obliged to laugh. When at
last he caught and handed back to me my property, we were
thoroughly exhausted and sat down at the foot of the hill on the
mossy tree-roots. I am sure we must have looked very silly, for we
were so out of breath that we could not leave off
laughing,&mdash;my young man has the heartiest laugh I ever heard.
When we had somewhat recovered, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why one always laughs when something blows
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he replied, with mock gravity, &ldquo;what
people call a wise dispensation of Providence. There is nothing
between laughter and tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It never entered my head to get up and go my way; his shyness,
too, seemed vanished; we were quite at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever noticed,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;how many
different kinds of moss there are in these woods?&rdquo;&mdash;and
we began to count the varieties as we sat. At last I looked up and
saw that the heavens were blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going uphill again,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to
see the sunset. How quickly the sky has cleared! It almost seems as
if some invisible broom had made a clean sweep of the
clouds.&rdquo; To which the young man answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a birch-broom. I see the marks of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We climbed the hill side by side; it did not seem at all strange
at the time. When we reached the summit, the sun was setting in
fullest glory, and we were silent. Suddenly he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be fire-worshippers! There is more of God in that
great light than in all the gospels of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a queer, comforting thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to
hear from a stranger in a wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck me afterwards that perhaps I, too, had said a queer
thing; but we seemed to understand each other. Presently we sat
down again, and he talked to me about the Parsees; he appears to
know a great deal about them.</p>
<p>We narrowly escaped a second run downhill; again the wind seized
my hat, but he nimbly caught it on the wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do as I do?&rdquo; he asked, passing
his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great mistake to
wear a hat, especially if one has a turn for
trespassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who tells you,&rdquo; laughed I then, &ldquo;that I am
trespassing? For aught you know, this may be my own
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at me curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, then, Emilia Fletcher?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>I nodded assent; whereupon he held out his hand and jerked his
head forward; it was evidently an attempt at courtesy. I took the
hand and laughed outright: he looked so funny with his bright eyes
twinkling beneath the tangled forelock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am glad
to meet you. The other day I asked to whom the land belonged, and
was told that you were half Italian and rather eccentric. You seem
to be a human being. I am glad to have met you. My name is Gabriel
Norton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the big bell rang out from the house, summoning me to
tea,&mdash;it had rung once already. So the apparition and I parted
company.</p>
<p>I wonder if he has caught cold; I am sure that I have; I have
been sneezing all the evening.</p>
<p>It may be very pleasant and romantic to sit on the moss with a
wood-sprite after a shower, but perhaps it is not very wise.</p>
<p>I must go and say good night downstairs. I left Miss Seymour
reading sentimental ballads on pauper childhood to the old ladies;
it must now be close upon their bed-time.</p>
<p class="signature">Good night, beloved.<br />
Your <span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<p>P.S. I forgot to say that he has one really fine point: his
hands are quite beautiful. I keep on wondering what you would think
of him. O dio! how good it was to laugh again.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XIII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, October
18th.</p>
<p>Very dear, I hope this letter will reach Vienna before you do,
and welcome you there. The words we write in one mood are read when
another has taken its place; perhaps you are as merry as a bird in
spring by this time,&mdash;perhaps not. My poor little dear. I know
myself what it is to sink into a bottomless pit of senseless
misery, but I must tell you that it nearly always happens when I am
idle.</p>
<p>A woman that is debarred from woman&rsquo;s best
profession&mdash;wifehood and motherhood&mdash;must find some other
work to do; idleness, uselessness&mdash;above all,
idleness&mdash;are the hotbed of all manner of follies. The
stupidest man in existence, working day by day at the worldliest
work, has the better of us in this, that he is weighted, so to
speak, and cannot flutter to and fro with every breeze that blows.
You say that you cannot work, that you have heard all this at least
a thousand times; well, never mind, hear it once more!</p>
<p>Take German lessons, your German is very bad; go on with your
singing, your sweet voice is very ignorant; read, make some study,
however unprofitable, of the French Revolution, the Renaissance,
the Conquest of Peru, anything, anything you like; or buy a
sewing-machine at least, and make flannel petticoats for the poor;
anything, Constantia, only don&rsquo;t for Heaven&rsquo;s sake sit
there with your hands in your lap, listening to the gabble of
fools, while Mrs. Rayner touches up a curl here and a frill there,
from morning till night, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>But now to other things, for indeed I am not in the
fault-finding mood you might suppose. Only, as you know well, I can
always worry about you, at any time.</p>
<p>Well, I have seen my wood-sprite again, this very morning. I
could not sleep after six, although I twice covered up my head with
the bed-clothes and made believe I was not awake; so I got up, and
the young sun was so beautiful, driving the mists out of the
valley, that I went out.</p>
<p>Between the flower garden and the park, there lies a shrubbery;
green paths wind in and out between high walls of box and laurel,
leading one at length to a little blue door in an old wall. Well, I
was stepping along between the evergreens as fast as the moss on
the pebbles would let me, swinging my hat round as I went, and
singing loudly, when I thought I heard footsteps round the bend of
the path. I turned the corner&mdash;nobody; only a little
scrambling sound, and the treacherous flutter of a branch in the
laurel hedge. Of course I immediately thought of poachers, and in
my imagination already saw Emilia Fletcher stretched a lifeless
corpse upon the ground. I took three backward steps, then paused.
Silence and stillness reigned.</p>
<p>Pooh! thought I, it&rsquo;s nothing, and with a bold, swift step
I walked past the fearful spot. No sooner had I passed than there
came another crackle; I turned and beheld a luminous eye between
the branches. Whether I turned pale with fright or not, I cannot
tell; but a hand came forth, a foot, then, with considerable
difficulty, an entire body; and on the path before me stood my
dishevelled friend, covered with green dust and blushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no excuse to offer,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>I laughed; there was nothing else to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did startle me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I forgive
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not ask him what he was doing in my shrubbery, nor did he
offer the least explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going for a walk?&rdquo; said he, simply,
&ldquo;and, if so, may I go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was glad enough, and we had taken a few steps forward when he
suddenly clapped his hands to his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to get into the bush again,&rdquo; he cried,
with rueful face; &ldquo;I must have dropped &lsquo;Peer
Gynt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in he scrambled, returning triumphant with an exceedingly
shabby book.</p>
<p>We walked a full hour and a half, through the park, through the
woods, and through the park again, for he insisted on bringing me
back to the little blue door. We talked mostly about &ldquo;Peer
Gynt,&rdquo; which, by the way, he is reading in the original. He
seems to read every possible language, although he declares he
speaks nothing but English. We did not talk at all about ourselves,
so I know nothing further about him, save that he lives in a
cottage on the heath towards Miltonhoe, with his father and his
aunt.</p>
<p>When we parted company, he asked me if I would mind going to see
his aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that she ought to call
first on you,&mdash;at least, she says so,&mdash;but that
she&rsquo;ll never do. If I landed her at your very door,
she&rsquo;d never find courage to ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to her
instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the sprite vanished.</p>
<p>I think I shall go to-morrow, or perhaps next day.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XIV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, October
23d.</p>
<p>You are a dear to take such becoming interest in my friend. I
have a great deal more to tell you about the lunatic, as you call
him, who, by the way, is a great deal saner than either you or
I.</p>
<p>Well, I went last Thursday. It took me some time to find the
cottage. After much rambling I came upon it in the most secluded
part of the Common, in a slight hollow. It is a sort of double
cottage, partly thatched, standing in a good-sized garden. I
marched through a rickety gate, and made for the house door. The
garden is one wild medley of vegetables, fruit-trees, and flowers,
luxuriant still, in spite of the late season. I was just bending
over a chrysanthemum when I heard a startling &ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo;
and found myself accosted by the gardener, who stood, spade in
hand, at the opposite end of the gravel walk. He was in his
shirtsleeves; his corduroy trousers were more picturesque than
respectable; an enormous straw hat, well tanned and chipped by
wear, was stuck on the back of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; he cried again.</p>
<p>I approached and asked, as soon as I could do so without
shouting, whether Miss Norton were at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is at home,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and who
may you be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will kindly tell her,&rdquo; said I, making
up by my civility for his lack of it, &ldquo;that Emilia Fletcher
has come to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down went the spade, off came the disreputable hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; he cried, rubbing the earth off
his fingers, &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed doubtful whether his hand were fit to offer me or not,
so I relieved him of his anxiety by shaking it warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on indoors,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
surprise them; Gabriel will be delighted,&rdquo; and he set off at
a trot, I after him. He was not a grand runner. I conjectured at
once that his health is not good, and that he probably looks ten
years older than he really is. His hair is almost white, his face
deeply wrinkled.</p>
<p>When we reached the cottage door, he pushed me gently in, and I
found myself in what appeared to be a lumber-room. There was a
table in the centre covered with bundles, books, and papers, on the
summit of which, precariously poised on the lid of a biscuit-tin,
stood a jug and some glasses; piles of books lay on the floor; in
one corner stood a stack of brooms, rakes, guns, fishing-rods,
sticks, and umbrellas; and a marvellous medley of coats and hats,
baskets, cords, etc., loaded a groaning row of pegs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; said the old man, tilting the only
chair in such a way that a Bible, a match-box, and a cocoa-tin
filled with nails were safely deposited on the floor. He then
popped his head in at three several doors that opened on to the
apartment (it was intended, I afterwards discovered, for the hall),
and finally disappeared behind one of them which led straight on to
a flight of stairs. Suddenly I heard a scuffling, a sound as of
some one coming down head foremost, and my friend appeared, book
and forelock and all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is nice of you!&rdquo; he cried; then his father
stumped downstairs again, followed by a tall, sweet-faced
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Jane,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there she
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went up to her; she was, indeed, very shy. &ldquo;Dear,
dear,&rdquo; was all she said; &ldquo;deary me, think of this,
it&rsquo;s very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; squeezing my
hand the while as if it had been a sponge.</p>
<p>She led me off through the door to the right, into a
comparatively presentable parlour; but her brother took my other
hand and pulled me in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no, no, we&rsquo;ll go
into the kitchen and have tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, come,&rdquo; said Gabriel; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,
aren&rsquo;t you? Let&rsquo;s go and find something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we recrossed the hall and passed through a good-sized room
which looked like a second-hand bookshop. Books overflowed the
shelves, and lay in piles in every available corner,&mdash;the
floor, the table, the old upright piano, the very chairs, were
covered with dusty volumes. Out of this room led the kitchen, which
at least looked clean. A rosy little maid was leaving after the
day&rsquo;s work as we entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Gabriel&rsquo;s father to me;
&ldquo;sit down, my dear; you shall have some tea in a
minute.&rdquo; And he began taking plates down from the dresser.
Miss Norton, meanwhile, had disappeared, and presently returned
with a loaf, dragging Gabriel after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep that boy out of the larder,&rdquo; she
said plaintively.</p>
<p>Gabriel laughed and fetched the teapot, also a jug and two paper
bags. I thought I had better help, too. I discovered some knives in
the drawer of the table, and set them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea or cocoa?&rdquo; asked Richard Norton, pointing his
finger at tea-pot and jug in turn. I chose cocoa, I can&rsquo;t
think why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky,&rdquo; sighed Gabriel;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no tea in the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the cocoa, Jane Norton cut the bread; at last we sat
down. I don&rsquo;t think I ever enjoyed a meal so much in my life.
They ate voraciously, and we talked meanwhile in the silliest
fashion, about nothing at all, laughing until the tears rolled down
our cheeks.</p>
<p>My friend is very funny, but his fun is of the kind that cannot
bear repeating; taken away from himself, separated from his
personality, it would sound merely foolish. You know what I mean. I
sat next Miss Norton during tea. When we had done, Gabriel stood
up, chair and all, and came beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of us?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we rather nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and the funny part
of it is that I feel as though I&rsquo;d known you all my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how I feel with you,&rdquo; said
Gabriel, and Richard Norton added,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you; you&rsquo;re a nice girl; you don&rsquo;t
turn up your nose at us because we live in our own way.
You&rsquo;re a nice girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your way of living,&rdquo; said I, then.
&ldquo;From what I can see, it seems to me you are about as free as
any one can be in this world, and that is the best of all
things,&mdash;freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it!&rdquo; cried Richard Norton,
bringing his flat hand down on the table. &ldquo;We are
free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Gabriel. &ldquo;This
time last year we had horrible lodgings in Bloomsbury. Father went
every day to drudgery in a dirty office, helping another man to rob
his fellow-creatures; aunt there gave lessons,&mdash;she
can&rsquo;t teach a bit; she was only putting nonsense into the
heads of future men and women, and, such as it was, putting it
there wrong. I was doing likewise, and I teach worse than she does.
Of an evening I wrote drivel for the papers. We were, every one of
us, useless and miserable. At last one day I said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; interrupted his father. &ldquo;You may
live to be a hundred, you&rsquo;ll never say anything so wise
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Look here! How many lives have we?&rsquo;
&lsquo;One,&rsquo; replied father. &lsquo;What are we alive
for?&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied father.
&lsquo;Neither do I; only I know that life&rsquo;s not worth living
as we live it. Let&rsquo;s go into the country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Gabriel,&rdquo; interrupted his father
again; &ldquo;it was not quite so, it was better than that. The boy
lectured me, Miss Fletcher,&mdash;pitched into me, and I deserved
it. He told me I was fifty-five and a fool for my years. So I was.
There was I, grinding away,&mdash;what for? We never saw each
other, we never saw the fields, we were selling all the joys of
life for three farthings. So we decided to drudge no more. Gabriel
would have continued, but I could not allow that; I wanted him
here. We found we should have just enough money to rent a cottage,
buy body-covering and plain food. So here we are. And we are happy.
As Gabriel said, What is the use of toiling for more, when the
unprofitable work that brings us a few extra shillings takes away
our capacities for enjoying life? Here we are, happy all day, eh,
Gabriel? He writes his poetry and devours his books, I devour mine,
Jane devours hers; we are learning now all the beauties of Nature,
and man&rsquo;s best thoughts. We are very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A vision of my present life flitted across me, like a cloud on a
sunlit field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how I envy you! Nothing
useless, not a clog about you, no stupid formalities, stifling
luxuries, no daily lies and false duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you all these?&rdquo; asked Gabriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so badly as some people, but badly enough. I have
money, and no end of respectable relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, and made a wry face.</p>
<p>When I found that it was time to wend my way home, Gabriel
offered to walk with me. I was very glad. On the way out, he
stopped in the hall and knocked half the things off the pegs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beloved aunt!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there used to be a
hat somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him that he need not discomfort himself for my sake,
and he bounded forth bareheaded, with a yell of exultation. On the
road we had a long and somewhat warm discussion on suicide, which
was started by an essay of Montaigne&rsquo;s he happened to be
reading. Every now and again he pulled the book from his pocket and
read me extracts, until it was too dark to see; even then he once
struck a match to find a passage.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument we occasionally took opposite sides,
but, in fact, we were both agreed upon the principal point; namely,
that although man enters the world against his will, he may surely
choose the time and the manner of his exit. That this is every
one&rsquo;s right we both believe, yet believe, also, that the
right should be sparingly used. For although suicide might almost
be considered an act of duty on the part of those suffering from
incurable disease, mental or physical, most of us, however useless
and superfluous we may at times believe ourselves to be, have,
willy-nilly, the fate of some fellow-creature bound up with our
own; and it is surely an act of unpardonable cowardice to make our
escape from a world of difficulties, leaving others to bear the
burden of our faults.</p>
<p>But, really, I must put an end to this letter; I never wrote
such a long one in my life, not even I, not even to you. My friend
left me as we approached Graysmill, saying that he dared not set
foot on the confines of respectability.</p>
<p>That was Thursday, and I have not seen him since.</p>
<p>Good-bye, my dearest; I kiss your sweet eyes.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, October
31st.</p>
<p>No, of course I have not said a word about it at the house; what
an idea! Why should I? Good gracious me, they&rsquo;d think me mad.
Besides, I am my own mistress, and am not answerable to anybody for
my actions. Not for the world would I speak of the Nortons to any
of these people here.</p>
<p>Ida Seymour is a fixture, for the present, at least. Her good
offices leave me a great deal more liberty than I enjoyed during
the first few months. Apart from meal-times I give some two hours a
day to my old ladies, and work hard the rest of the time. I have
finished &ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; and laid it aside to await
revision; I am now sorting my mother&rsquo;s papers, with a view to
some day publishing a selection of them. Perhaps. But there is such
a sacredness to me about all she has left behind, that I cannot yet
bear the thought of sending anything that remains of her out into
the cold world, to be misjudged and misprized.</p>
<p>How can you ask me what colour his eyes are? When did you know
me care for any one&mdash;except mamma&mdash;whose eyes were not
blue? His are very dark, and very beautiful. I cannot think, by the
way, why I ever told you that he might perhaps be considered plain.
I looked at him hard yesterday, and cannot think what possessed me
to say such a thing; for he is certainly as far from plain as any
man I ever set eyes on. It&rsquo;s really very strange that I did
not see it at once.</p>
<p>You see, we have met again. Five days passed, and I must admit
that I found them dull. To be quite sincere, I will also admit that
I once walked towards Miltonhoe, and was disappointed not to meet
him. At last, on Wednesday morning, I received a note from him. He
writes a good hand, although not a firm one&mdash;he makes two or
three of his letters in two or three different ways. I would send
you the letter, only mine is sure to be heavy enough without
enclosures. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dear Miss Fletcher</em>,&mdash;I am afraid of your butler.
What is to be done? I tried this afternoon to pay you a call, but
my courage vanished at the lodge. I think we did not quite exhaust
our subject last Thursday. I have thought a great deal more about
it, and I dare say you have done likewise. Can I see you by any
means without facing the butler? I shall sit in the laurel hedge
every morning, on the chance of your taking another walk before
breakfast.</p>
<p class="signature">Your humble servant,<br />
<span class="sc">Gabriel Norton</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not go next morning, although I wished to do so. I hardly
know why I waited until Friday; it was not only unreasonable on my
part, but also not quite straightforward. How is it that, even when
circumstances might enable us to act according to our impulses,
some unexpected inconsistency in our own selves throws a bar across
the path? I begin to think that it must be an idle
dream,&mdash;sincerity, self-honesty. My thoughts are fixed upon it
constantly, I strive towards it with heart and soul; yet daily,
under the very eyes of my own scrutiny, I lie either in word or in
action.</p>
<p>Well, on Friday I went, and we had a happy time together. I
cannot tell you how grateful I am to have met this creature, to
come once again into contact with a being whose footsteps fall near
my own. We are are very different, yet I feel that our faces are
turned towards the same light. I told him a great deal about my
mother; she would have loved him.</p>
<p>There goes the second bell, and I have not even washed my hands.
Farewell for to-day.</p>
<p class="signature">Yours in all truth,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XVI.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, November
8th.</p>
<p>My little dear Constance, first and foremost I am freezing, and
have got a red nose, I&rsquo;m certain. Is it cold with you also?
The week has been a full one. Uncle George&rsquo;s eldest daughter
was married the day before yesterday, and there were great
festivities in the family. The marriage should have taken place
last June, but was postponed owing to the grandfather&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p>What extraordinary creatures we are! I cannot tell you how many
Emilias were at that wedding. Something in me was touched by the
sight of a large family assembled from far and wide, excited and
united for the moment by a common sentiment; something in me was
lonely beyond description, for I was not of them; and whereas I
smiled and made merry in a white gown and felt the tears come to my
eyes when the little bride went forth under a shower of rice, I was
nevertheless looking on at the smiles and tears of the others with
doubt and cynicism rampant in my heart.</p>
<p>Poor little bride! I wondered how much she thought she loved
him, how much he cared for her; and where her smiles and her golden
dreams would be this time next year, poor little white thing,
veiled in ignorance.</p>
<p>It is not altogether a bad world, for all that. I certainly have
not found it so; but then it has been my good fortune to draw near
the hearts and brains of some very dear mortals. I cannot tell you
how fond I have grown of this creature,&mdash;Gabriel Norton, I
mean. I can say this openly to you, because you are sensible and
know me, and will not think at once, because he is a man and I a
woman, that there is any question here of sentiments exceeding
friendship. We are neither of us children; he is three or four
years older than I, I should imagine,&mdash;twenty-nine or thirty,
or thereabouts.</p>
<p>For aught I know, he may already have loved and lost as I have;
and were it even possible that I should ever love again, I hardly
think that Gabriel would be the man. Anyway, we are excellent
friends, and I believe that my companionship has become as precious
to him as his is to me. We meet now every two or three days, and
walk together, either before breakfast or after early dinner.</p>
<p>Did your ears burn on Wednesday? I told him a great deal about
you. We had been having one of our customary argumentative
conversations, principally about marriage, more especially still
about the horrors of false marriages, and this led me to tell him
that the best friend I have on earth is infamously bound for the
whole of her dear life by a marriage contracted before she was
seventeen years old. He thinks, dearest, with me, that you ought to
face the horrors of the divorce court rather than linger on in
chains, and certainly listen no longer to the considerations,
pecuniary and otherwise, which influence your mother.</p>
<p>I fancy, from the way in which he spoke, that his father and
mother were not happy together; he has therefore not had in his
life the blessing that was mine,&mdash;the daily contemplation of
an absolutely perfect union. Indeed, he hardly seems to believe in
the possibility of ideal marriages, and declares that he himself
will certainly never marry unless some law is passed whereby men
and women shall be able to bind themselves for a limited number of
years, at the expiration of which they may either renew the bond or
go free. I laughed when he said this, for I thought he was jesting;
so he was, partly, yet more than half in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I shall never marry. I had
sooner not break the laws of my country, but if it came to be a
question between breaking them or the laws of true morality, I
should not hesitate in my choice. Love without marriage is a sin
against society; marriage without love is a sin against
Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he is right. How my mother would have loved him! Do
you remember her invectives against marriage? It was the very
perfection of the tie between her and my father that filled her
with indignation and regret whenever she looked about her and
beheld, on all sides, the parody of her heaven.</p>
<p>Good-bye. You are getting very lazy, Mrs. Norris. How dare you
leave me letterless so long?</p>
<p>Write directly you get this to</p>
<p class="signature">Your loving<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XVII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, November
21st.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I have been a little cross with
you, Constance of my heart. My anger did not last long, but even
when it was practically at an end I felt obliged to play at being
cross with you, and therefore would not write. But to-day comes
another sweet letter from you, and I am miserable to think you
should have had to write a second time before getting an answer to
your dear words. Forgive me! I do love you so! I shall tell you
quite frankly why I was cross. You must never tease me again about
Gabriel Norton. I don&rsquo;t like to be teased at the best of
times, and I think it positively wrong to make love a subject for
laughter and nonsense. You see, I allow that I love him; of course
I do, but not as you imagine. Surely there is a love of spirit to
spirit which stands higher than the material love of man and woman.
It is just because we look upon each other in the first place as
human beings, as comrades on the road of life, that our friendship
is a source of strength and comfort to us. If either were to
harbour other thoughts, all that is beautiful in our intercourse
must come to an end. No, you are silly; you must never say such
things again, promise me that. Why, it is just the very absence of
love that <em>makes</em> our friendship. If only people would
believe this, if only men and women would learn to exchange their
thoughts in freedom, to be simple and open in their dealings with
each other, what a much better world this world would be!</p>
<p>But you are just like the rest; indeed, worse than the rest.
Because, somehow or other, whether it&rsquo;s the fault of your
curls or of your lips, or of your smile, or of your whole sweet
self, I know not, but because no man ever draws near you but what
you make a fool of him, you seem to think all men resemble your
victims, all women you, their bane. No, you don&rsquo;t, though; I
malign you. Do you remember saying to me one day: &ldquo;Try and
make yourself appear a little silly sometimes, Emilia, do, now! Men
never fall in love with clever women!&rdquo; And right you were.
The only passions I ever inspired flared through their day in the
bosoms of women and boys. Never mind! I had sooner have
Gabriel&rsquo;s friendship than ten thousand of your lovers; I had
sooner see you too, sweet, with such a friend as he to lean upon,
than surrounded as you are now by the foolish and ugly admiration
of worthless men.</p>
<p>There, enough lecturing for the present. It&rsquo;s understood,
eh?</p>
<p>Gabriel and Jane Norton have actually been here to tea. What do
you say to that? I must tell you how it came about; it&rsquo;s a
long story, but you shall have it all. The other day, my friend and
I were overtaken by a rain-storm on the heath; we ran as fast as we
could to the Thatched Cottage, and there I remained fully two
hours, till the rain had given over. As Gabriel was very restless
and unmanageable, I suggested that we might turn his superfluous
energy to good account by arranging the library. How those dear
creatures keep alive, I cannot imagine; they are helpless and
unpractical beyond all belief. Jane Norton has absolutely no sense
of order, the household drifts along as best it can. &ldquo;I hate
it so,&rdquo; she groans; &ldquo;I have a horror of it all.&rdquo;
That very afternoon I tore my dress and wanted to mend it. A brass
thimble was soon produced from the kitchen clock, where Jane keeps
it &ldquo;to have it handy,&rdquo; but never were needle and thread
more difficult to procure. After much hunting, a dirty reel of
white cotton was discovered in the soup-tureen, the needle-case had
entirely disappeared; she finally managed, however, to squeeze some
rusty kind of skewer out of her pincushion, and with these
implements I mended my skirt as best I could. But to return to the
library. The confusion we found it in is indescribable. When first
we began operations Gabriel stood about in a helpless way, but he
became enthusiastic as the work of clearance advanced, and laboured
with good will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a veritable inspiration!&rdquo; he cried
presently, perching himself upon the table; &ldquo;there
hasn&rsquo;t been a corner to sit upon for weeks, not for weeks.
It&rsquo;s very odd: I believe that I much prefer to see things
kept in order, only I haven&rsquo;t the least idea how to bring
such a state about. None of us have. Why! there&rsquo;s Plato!
Blessings upon you, Emilia! He must have been behind the piano
quite two months. I have hunted for him high and low.&rdquo; He
seized the volume rapturously and began reading aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all Greek to me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s leave
off now, the room&rsquo;s beautiful; come, I&rsquo;ll teach you the
alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was the germ of a scheme we have started. We had been
racking our brains for some time past how to meet during the
winter, in defiance of shortening days, cold, rain, and prejudice.
Now we have it. He is to teach me Greek, and will come to the house
to give me lessons. Thanks to my foreign extraction and to a
certain reputation I have got here for originality, my old ladies
were not at all surprised when I told them that a poor gentleman
who lived with his father and his aunt towards Miltonhoe was coming
twice a week to teach me. On the contrary, their kind old hearts
were touched at the mere mention of poverty, and they asked if I
wouldn&rsquo;t invite Miss Norton to tea; hence Monday&rsquo;s
tea-party, which was exceedingly funny. Ida Seymour had gone to a
school treat at Miltonhoe, so my old ladies and I had the place to
ourselves. They were much distressed, bless them, at the
extraordinary antiquity of Jane Norton&rsquo;s black silk gown;
Heaven only knows in what year of Grace it was fabricated, and how
she manages to keep it together. I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have some
difficulty in preventing Aunt Caroline from giving Jane a new
dress,&mdash;she certainly won&rsquo;t rest till she has done so.
As for Gabriel, he was so remarkably dusty and threadbare that I
set him at table with his back to the light, in such a manner that
his mere silhouette was exposed to Hopkinson&rsquo;s scrutiny. I
must allow, however, that he behaved beautifully, and Jane was
perfect; she made an excellent impression on grandmamma, who is
very anxious I should invite her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
she shouldn&rsquo;t come and have a cup of tea with us every time
your teacher comes; then we shall know she has a good tea twice a
week at least, poor thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I see him without these subterfuges? Why
can&rsquo;t we meet here in my house in all simplicity, without
fear of that monster, the world, and its murderous tongue? It all
seemed so good and so simple that morning when he said to
me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be friends as friends should be; all shall be
true and free between us; we shall make exchange of our thoughts,
and learn together how to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never mind; I am very fortunate.</p>
<p>Good-bye, my sweet dear, and again, forgive me! I love you.</p>

<p>Bless you for all your words! Yes, you must come out to me next
spring, and then we three can be friends together: three should be
more beautiful than two, in such harmony as ours would be. I take
it for granted that you and Gabriel will care for each other; it
would be a great grief to me if you did not. I hate people I like
not to like each other; nothing hurts more&mdash;except, perhaps,
to oneself dislike a friend&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>My Greek is getting on; I am fearfully industrious, and have
even pinned up the declensions, written out in a large hand, on my
bedroom wall, so that I can learn them whilst I dress.</p>
<p>Gabriel is quite pleased with his pupil, and I have begun to
teach him Italian. He reads it very well, but cannot speak it at
all at present. We had a long talk, the other day, about his
future. I think it will be quite impossible for him to continue
this mode of life very long; I find that I am not so happy about
him as I was at first. Sometimes I think I should like to give him
half my money&mdash;how ridiculous it seems that such a thing
should be out of the question!&mdash;and let him lead the tranquil
life of study and contemplation that he loves, send him to other
lands where he might wander up and down in the sunshine, seeing the
world and all its beauties,&mdash;he that has eyes to see, a heart
to feel. But then, at other times, I feel that I should like to
strip him even of the little he has, and hurl him into the very
vortex of life, see him struggle and fight and come out a
conqueror. I see in him the germs of so much greatness that I
cannot believe he was meant to dream his days away on the heather.
It was right of him, certainly, to break from a course of life he
felt himself unable to pursue, and right it is also that he should
pause now, and breathe, and feel his wings. But it will soon be
time for energy and action. We are not here for ourselves only;
there is so much to be done. And if I am often discontented with
myself for the futility of my dreams, for sitting here a mere
spectator, as it were, of struggles that I long to share, yet know
not how, greater still is my impatience at the sight of one wasting
his days in mere speculation, who, having all the strength, the
manhood, that I lack, might leap into the very thick of the fight,
Truth&rsquo;s warrior.</p>
<p>He tells me that he has written a great deal, and has promised
to bring me a bundle of poems to read at my leisure. &ldquo;You
must understand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you will be the only
one to whom I ever showed them.&rdquo; I feel very proud.</p>
<p>To revert to what I said above, I believe, too, that it is very
bad for any man not to have a fixed occupation; however great his
natural energy may be, it either relaxes with time, or expends
itself uselessly. The mere thinker often ends by hovering on the
confines of lunacy.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XIX.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, November
30th.</p>
<p>I write to you very soon, partly because of your letter that
crossed mine, but principally because I feel that I must write you
a few words before I go to sleep. I have just gone through
Gabriel&rsquo;s poems, and am beside myself with wonder. Constance,
the creature is a genius. I marvel at my happiness, that I should
have touched his life. No, I&rsquo;ll not write; I feel that, if I
do, I shall write bosh. Good-night; I hope you are sleeping fast at
this moment,&mdash;and he too.</p>
<p class="address">December 1st.</p>
<p>We had a walk this afternoon. He looks pale, poor dear! he has
had a cold. How it hurts to see ill-health on a face that one
loves!</p>
<p>We had a great altercation about his poems. I could not speak of
them when I put the manuscript into his hands; any words I might
have used must have sounded fulsome flattery. But later on, I
asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought of a publisher for your
verse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head and made a face at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must certainly publish those poems,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;you surely know that they are unusually beautiful, and that
you have no right to keep them to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Emilia,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I like to hear
this from you, but you are mistaken. My poems are not so remarkable
as you imagine; you are too near a friend to be a fair judge. They
are intensely subjective,&mdash;that is, by the way, one of their
faults; they reflect me; therefore you, who know me well and care
for me, find them sympathetic. That&rsquo;s the whole of the
tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I cared for you ten times more than I do,&rdquo; said
I then, &ldquo;I should not be quite so blind as you suppose. But,
if you doubt my judgment, ask some one else, or compare the poems
yourself with other verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can you even suggest
such a thing? Look here, Emilia. A man has an ideal, a glimpse of
something glittering up there in highest Heaven; he tries to shape
his vision into words. When he afterwards turns to his work coldly,
critically, how shall he judge? He must take measure by the height
of the ideal, not by the achievement of another, even if that other
be nearer Heaven than himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found this very fine and true, yet selfish. Had he ever
climbed less high than he wished, he might at least stand forth,
and showing where he stood, stretch out a hand to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied again, &ldquo;no, I am too weak
myself to help others. Dear girl, don&rsquo;t you see that those
things were written with the blood of my heart? Cold men would read
them, tear them to pieces. Emilia! they would review me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this with a sort of yell of despair. I saw that he was
in a perfectly impossible mood, so I left him in peace. We talked
of you afterwards, and he sent you his love. Was that bold or not?
If you don&rsquo;t care for the gift, send it back to me. I am very
hungry for that same food.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XX.</h3>
<p class="address">December 6th.</p>
<p>The snow is on the ground; &rsquo;tis a beautiful white world.
Yet to-day has been a dull day. I had my lesson yesterday. I spent
the whole of this afternoon preparing a list of Christmas
charities, in which Aunt Caroline and Ida Seymour helped me, good
souls. I can think of nothing but flannel this evening. That is a
lie, by the way; I almost wish it were not. Yesterday Gabriel and I
had an adventure. I was walking part of the way back with him and
Jane Norton, who had been taking tea with my old ladies, and as we
went past a cottage, just off the lane, we heard fearful screams.
Gabriel sprang in, I following, and there we found a woman beating
a little girl with a broom. Gabriel&rsquo;s eyes were like fire; he
caught the child in one hand, the broom in the other; I thought he
meant to bring it down on the woman&rsquo;s back. We stayed there
some time, he lecturing the mother, I consoling the poor mite. She
was wretchedly clad; I shall bring her some clothes to-morrow.</p>
<p>I am dull. I meant to write you a long letter, but somehow I
can&rsquo;t. Farewell until to-morrow.</p>
<p class="address">December 13th.</p>
<p>What will you be thinking of me? Your silence is almost more
unbearable than a letter of reproach would be; I had not realised
until I found the above fragment in my desk just now, how miserably
long it is since last I wrote to you. Write to me, my dearest; I
need to feel your love. I think I am not very well just now; you
must forgive me, yet don&rsquo;t be anxious on my account. I
don&rsquo;t feel very well, that&rsquo;s all; there is nothing the
matter with me. Neither is there anything to tell you; all goes on
as usual. Gabriel is well.</p>
<p>Oh, my pretty Constance, I cannot write! I shall send off this
miserable scrap, and write again very soon.</p>
<p class="signature">Your poor fool,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXI.</h3>
<p class="address">December 18th.</p>
<p>Thank Heaven that you are here, in the world; I should die if
you were not. Let me think, where shall I begin? At the end; that
is nearest. I have only just come upstairs; I have been shaking in
the dark. They are beasts; I hate them all. I was sitting playing
cribbage with grandmamma after supper, when Uncle George was
announced. He wanted to speak to me, he said. I took him into the
breakfast room, and there he told me in a fat pompous voice that
I&mdash;O Dio, my blood still burns to think of it, and the way in
which he said it&mdash;that I was getting myself talked about in
the neighbourhood; that probably I didn&rsquo;t know, owing to my
foreign education, that it wasn&rsquo;t the thing here in England
to let oneself be seen constantly alone in the company of a young
man; that he thought it his duty, etc., etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I,&mdash;my very skin felt
tight,&mdash;&ldquo;I see that I must be more underhand in my
actions, and contrive to see my friends entirely on the
sly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, my dear niece,&rdquo; interrupted Uncle
George, &ldquo;but I feel it my duty to fill a father&rsquo;s place
by you. It isn&rsquo;t as if you could possibly marry this young
Norton; he hasn&rsquo;t a penny; and as it is now some time since
first the rumour of your very careless behaviour reached my ears, I
have been able to make full inquiries into the matter. His
antecedents, to say no more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance, did you ever hear of such infamy. I believe I grew
perfectly green; Heaven knows what I said, but you have seen me
lose my temper once! When I mastered myself, Uncle George was
standing by the door, looking considerably startled; I was on a
chair, shaking from head to foot. After a moment&rsquo;s silence I
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon for losing my self-control as I did
just now; I am very sorry, but you have done me a great wrong. I
know you meant it for the best; so we will say no more about it. I
only hope that you will leave me and my friends alone in future. I
am twenty-six and my own mistress, and I care for my good name
every whit as much as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he left me, and I came upstairs.</p>
<p>So now they have done it! They have touched my paradise with
their dirty fingers. O Constance! how is it to be borne? My one
comfort is that Gabriel knows nobody, hears nothing; if such talk
were to reach his ears, I should kill myself.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps it is just as well that this blow has come to me. It
has given me the shock I needed. I have made up my mind to keep
away from Gabriel as long as I can; it is best so. Christmas
charities, etc., will serve as a sufficient excuse.</p>
<p>Constance, I am going to tell you all; I trust so to your
understanding and your love. It seems strange, perhaps, to speak as
I am about to speak; I shall burst if I don&rsquo;t. It is this: I
love him, I love him horribly, horribly; I cannot bear it. Why must
one do this? Why couldn&rsquo;t it last, our white friendship? On
his side it might; he loves me, I know, but only as I loved him at
first. He loves me very much. I am grown in a way indispensable to
him, but his love makes him content; it will not kill him. Mine is
grown unbearable.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have told you this before, yet I have not known
it very long. I knew some time ago that all my joy is in him; he
has been for many weeks the goal of my eyes, the centre of my
thought; the time I spent away from him was dead time; when I was
with him I was flooded in peace. But all this was joy, not pain.
That came later; the time I spent away from him was no longer dead,
it was living longing.</p>
<p>One day, about a week ago, I had forgotten him (I forget how I
managed that!), but suddenly the thought of him returned to me. I
felt a sudden sharp pain at my heart, a sort of aching that tingled
through me to my very finger-tips. I knew then how it was with
me.</p>
<p>Next day I did not go to meet him in the wood as I had promised;
I went straight to the cottage; I feared myself. When he returned
at tea-time, he came up to me and took my hand with more friendship
than of wont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Emilia!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;why have you failed
me? I have been so anxious; I feared you were ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this as a brother might have said it; he looked me full
in the face as serenely as the stars at night. I looked back at
him; his calm fell upon me, and I laughed at myself for my fears. I
got better after that, yet not well; I was never at ease. To-day we
were together very long; I was perfectly happy; we had spoken of
beautiful things, calmly, in great peace. But at parting he forgot
to let my hand go; he held it so long that I had time to feel his,
and my blood bounded through me in great waves. I still think he
must have felt it; if he did, I can never look at him again.</p>
<p>I hate myself for loving him so; I hate myself that I suffer
through him; the fault seems his, being entirely mine.</p>
<p>And now I wish that I had never seen him, that all these days of
joy were wiped out of my life; for the joy is turned to misery and
pain, and for this there can be no cure. If he grew to love me as I
do him, it would be unearthly; such happiness is not for this
world. I think that if he loved me, one of us would surely die.
This is the world, O Constance! Bursts of beauty, bursts of bliss,
but none to live untouched, none to endure.</p>
<p>I have been happy; I should not groan.</p>
<p class="signature">Write to me, dear.<br />
Your <span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, December
29th.</p>
<p>You must hear from me once again this year, my Constance. Oh,
dearest, dearest, it has only come to me of late, when my love for
you has shone dimly compared to another, what it is worth to me,
your love. I cannot express myself; I am all entangled, hopeless.
But what I mean is this: you have been one long joy to me, a sun
that has had no setting. I would I were as I used to be, untouched
by the knowledge that love can be hard pain. My sweet dear, you
were enough; why have I learned this bitter knowledge? Oh, how I
laugh of a night, thinking of myself six months ago, thinking of
what I then mistook for love!</p>
<p>Eleven days since I saw him. I have been conscious of every
hour. We were busy here; there is much to do at Christmas time. I
wrote to him that I could take no more lessons nor even walk with
him for the present, as I must devote myself entirely to the
Christmas work, and he has written to me twice. He would have me
think that he sits there forlorn, cursing Yule-tide and charity; he
says in the letter I received this morning, that it is time my
charity were turned in his direction. I think I shall go to the
cottage this afternoon; there is an end to all endurance. Or shall
I wait until New Year&rsquo;s day? Perhaps that were best. I like
to try my strength, to see how much can be borne.</p>
<p>I can write no more now; I must try to get through a few other
letters. I have sent no cards to Florence. What a worm I am!</p>
<p>Your words of love have helped me through these days; I carry
the three dear letters, along with his, in my pocket.</p>
<p>Good-bye, dearest; blessings upon you. I think I shall set forth
in search of you very soon. May the New Year be kind to us all!</p>
<p class="signature">Yours in deepest love,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXIII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, January
1st.</p>
<p>My pretty sweet, I have had much happiness to-day. First of all,
a letter from you at breakfast, and one from Gabriel, then,
sunshine all the morning, and all the morning a song in my heart;
to-day I shall see him!</p>
<p>I set off immediately after early dinner, and walked across the
Common to the Thatched Cottage. I cannot tell you what it was to me
to catch sight of the chimney and the purling smoke again; I had to
stand still and wait a while, my heart thumped so. (A fool, eh?) I
crept noiselessly into the house, and through the hall, then
stealthily opened the study door. There he sat on the ground by the
fire, with his back to me, reading, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a careless person!&rdquo; said I, softly;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll blind himself one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up he jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;dear Emilia!&rdquo; and,
catching me by both wrists, swung my arms up and down and to and
fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You faithless thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you false
friend, I hate you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Richard Norton ran in from the kitchen, with the teapot in
his hand, followed by Jane; they both covered me with welcomes and
reproaches. I was very happy, I assure you. We went into the
kitchen and had early tea, talking all the while and all together.
Gabriel was in one of his impish moods, and made me laugh till I
cried. The first thing I thought, when I had time to think, was
that I had been a fool to keep away so long and allow myself to
grow sentimental; that it was altogether much more healthful for me
to be in his dear company.</p>
<p>I came home in a much better frame of mind, although Gabriel
insisted on walking nearly as far as Graysmill with me, and said as
we parted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must never again leave me for so long, Emilia; I am
lost without you, I am, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned from him, half wishing he had not said this, feeling a
little giddy, a little less strong; but, as I ran along, something
hit me on the shoulder. I looked behind me, and there he stood,
like an imp of mischief, pelting me with pine-cones, which it seems
he had collected in his pocket for that purpose. So I had to laugh,
and was cured again.</p>
<p>The year has at least begun well.</p>
<p>Adieu, my sweetest. Things are often not so bad as we imagine.
With this truism I take my leave of you.</p>
<p class="signature">Your <span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<p>I think I forgot to send a New Year&rsquo;s wish to Mrs. Rayner.
For you, my love, again all the good that this world holds. May it
rain upon you in ceaseless showers!</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXIV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, January
15th.</p>
<p>I have grown unutterably selfish. I only remembered this morning
that you had asked me to send you those books. To think that a day
should have come when I could forget to do something you had asked
me! I have seen to it, with much penitence. Forgive me!</p>
<p>Your Emilia is a miserable specimen; she despises herself very
much. I go up and down all day like something that has lost its
balance, neither have I any. One hour I am absolutely happy; the
next I am biting the dust. One day I say to myself, I will never
walk or talk or read or sit alone with him again,&mdash;and perhaps
for that one day I keep my word. But then, the next, I do all I
meant not to do, I pine for it till I bring it about. And when I
have sat beside him a little while, doing my lessons, the Greek
loses its hold of my poor brain, my head swims, I make a blunder;
then he laughs and says he cannot understand how such an apparently
clever woman can have such a sieve for a brain. I laugh, and tell
him he&rsquo;s unmannerly. Then we both laugh, and I am well until
I am ill again.</p>
<p>It is only since I knew Gabriel that I know how to laugh. I
don&rsquo;t mean to say that I never laughed before. Do you
remember how we sometimes screamed up in my room at Florence? I
remember, too, as a child, going into wild fits of laughter, and
mamma and I having to wipe each other&rsquo;s eyes. But these days
were few and far between. I have learned to laugh with my years.
Very fine wit is lost upon me, and I have certainly no native
humour of my own; but I do know how to laugh about nothing at all,
how to make merry over the thorns of life! Laughter was not meant
for the joyful; it was made for us, the sombre of soul, to save our
heart-strings here and there; like the song of a lark in the sky,
to bid us lift our eyes from the dust of the road.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I have been laughing very much, and then
remember my pain, I see the vision of a child that dances on a
grave-mound in the sun.</p>
<p>Sweet, I&rsquo;ll go on to-morrow.</p>
<p class="address">January 20th.</p>
<p>I distinguished myself to-day! It came on to pour while I was at
the Cottage, and, in spite of a certain caution that has crept into
my actions of late, I stayed there the whole afternoon.</p>
<p>Jane was actually making herself a new dress, so I offered to
help her, and we sewed by lamplight at the kitchen table, it being
a very dark afternoon. Gabriel joined us after a while; he thought
we looked so cosy that he brought his books and sat at the table
too, just opposite me.</p>
<p>You have never really loved any man, you, so perhaps you
don&rsquo;t know what it is to be afraid of your own eyes, because
you feel that every time they rest on that thing you love, your
poor heart runs and looks out of window.</p>
<p>I seldom look at Gabriel now,&mdash;I dare not. But there he sat
opposite me, poring over his book. Jane was bent over her sewing. I
forgot her, and I forgot my work too; it slipped from my fingers
and fell into my lap. Suddenly he raised his head,&mdash;it seemed
as if all the blood in my body rushed to my face; he had caught me
all unguarded; what he might not know was laid bare before him.
With a dull, wide gaze he stared at me, then bent over his book
again; he had not seen me; he had merely looked up to get a better
view, as it were, of something he had in mind.</p>
<p>Then I, too, bent my head low, for hot tears stood in my silly
eyes, and, to my surprise, I felt a soft hand tuck my hair behind
my ears, caressingly. I looked up and saw a world of pity in Jane
Norton&rsquo;s face. When presently Gabriel left the room to fetch
another volume, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, he must never know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she answered, speaking as softly as I
had done, &ldquo;there is no fear that he should learn it from
<em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From me, then?&rdquo; asked I; &ldquo;is it so
plain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as pale as the table,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Take care of yourself, Em,&mdash;don&rsquo;t be unhappy,
all&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Gabriel came in, and I left soon after. You see what
an enemy I am to myself.</p>
<p>Good night, dearest; I am your</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, January
29th.</p>
<p>It is so easy to imagine the bright side of things when one is
too far away to see the truth. Silly Constance, cruel Constance,
what is the use of sending me such words of false hope? It does not
follow, because you love me best of all the world, that another
should do likewise. No, no; you know nothing at all about it, and
yet in spite of all reason, I catch at every straw you send
drifting towards me. Once and for all, of course he loves me, but
it stands just so. He loves me too well in one way to love me in
another. If he loved me less, he might love me more. I have said
all this to Jane. She declares that the only reason why he is not
in love with me is that an obstacle stands in the way which has
stood in the way all along, and which he has never dreamed of
surmounting. She means my accursed money. I told her she was
completely mistaken; that love, inevitable love, knows nothing of
obstacles; besides, this could not be an obstacle between him and
me,&mdash;he is too unworldly to be the slave of such prejudice. If
I thought she was right, who knows but what I should send my money
spinning into the lap of Charity, and let that lady dispense it as
indiscriminately and wastefully as she pleases. No, no; the fault
lies in another direction. There has been a little mistake
somewhere; I am not the lost half of his soul, for all that he is
mine.</p>
<p>Little Constance, I think now that perhaps you were right when
you said that I was not altogether a woman. I am certainly not made
as a woman should be. A woman may return love, but she must never
dare to give it. I have been guilty of this folly, and now, what is
to become of me?</p>
<p>We are such fools, we women. When a man loves, he is all that he
was, plus love; when we love, we throw ourselves headlong into the
flood, and are nothing that we were.</p>
<p>So now you know all about it, and can prepare yourself for a gay
companion. I have made up my mind to leave England, and join you in
Vienna. No, it must be Italy; you must leave Vienna and come
towards me.</p>
<p>You cannot see that between the last sentence and this there is
a pause of ten minutes. It is all very well for me to talk of
leaving Graysmill; I do talk of it, the words are words, but I
don&rsquo;t understand them. I cannot leave; I ought to,&mdash;yet,
Constance, I cannot leave him!</p>
<p>Write, you, and tell me where we shall meet; not in Florence, I
could not bear that. And yet, perhaps, yes, in Florence. It will
have to be, and I shall not realise that I have left him until I am
with you again. There is comfort in that thought. One can do
anything, after all, with a little determination, can&rsquo;t one,
Constantia? Not that you can judge, you who never had any. Perhaps
I have none myself, who knows? I have so deceived myself in loving
Gabriel, and laid bare such great and unknown weakness in my own
bosom, that all the world is upside down for me, and I can find my
way no longer.</p>
<p>Write and tell me soon where we shall meet.</p>
<p class="signature">Your <span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXVI.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, February
7th.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all settled. You are very good to me, my pretty
Constance. Now I say to myself hourly, &ldquo;In sixteen days I
shall see her,&rdquo; and oh, believe me, I am glad! I think I am
beginning to lose my head, that I am fit for all folly. We walked
together yesterday; we were not very talkative. In the lane, when
we were coming home, a man on a bicycle turned sharply round the
corner, and I was lost in thought, so that I was caught unawares,
and in fact knew nothing of the matter until I felt myself pulled
aside by Gabriel. I thought he would let go my arm, but he did not,
and for the few yards of road that remained I could not see out of
my eyes. I said to myself, &ldquo;He is holding my
arm,&mdash;perhaps he loves me.&rdquo; I was a fool; of course, it
meant nothing; and I am certain, too, that it was imagination on my
part led me to believe he looked differently at me when he said
good-bye.</p>
<p>That is what frightens me. Of course, it was pure self-delusion;
but, if I am going to begin that sort of folly, it is high time to
come away. Indeed, the folly of it. Besides, I suppose I ought to
feel ashamed. I am sure he knows now quite well that I love him,
and perhaps that is why he looked strangely at me when he said
good-bye. But I don&rsquo;t want his pity; O God forbid! Nor his,
nor anybody&rsquo;s. Do you hear? Never pity me, Constance.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXVII.</h3>
<p class="address">February 12th.</p>
<p>Could you meet me a little sooner, perhaps, and not wait until
the twenty-third? I must leave Graysmill at once. I shall go to the
Cottage to-morrow afternoon, and tell them. I shall tell the others
tonight, and on Monday I shall leave Graysmill forever. If you
think you cannot reach Florence by Wednesday or Thursday, never
mind, you will join me as soon as you can; only send me a telegram.
I can go and stay with Marianna until you come.</p>
<p>I can bear it no longer! The world holds but one thought; the
day and the night are lost in the constant reiteration of every
word he ever said to me, in the resuscitation of every glance,
every touch. And, poring over these in my memory, I try to read
between the lines the words that are not there, to read &ldquo;I
love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, I am very weak, yet, believe me, it is all against my will.
I have fought this folly, I despise myself utterly, and yet now I
am swept away by the flood, I can struggle no more. I shall die of
this, or run mad.</p>
<p>I met him out to-day. We had not arranged to meet; but, as I
went out at the blue door, there he stood. We went a little way
together; then I left him; it was unbearable. It was so beautiful
once to be with him, when we could talk freely of all that is best
and noblest in life. I cannot talk to him now, sometimes I cannot
even hear what he says to me. I cannot see the sky, the broad white
earth; I see him only. I cannot hear the life-sounds about me; I
only hear his footfall in the snow. It is all pain, all dreadful
pain, dreadful, unbearable longing.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I put an end to all this? Why can&rsquo;t I go
to him and say, I love you, tell me the truth? I know it,&mdash;the
truth,&mdash;he does not love me; and yet, until I hear his lips
say it, a false hope that reason cannot kill will linger on in my
heart,&mdash;linger on, I know it, even when I have placed time and
space between him and me.</p>
<p>Only one life, and there we stand, two spirits under the sky,
two that believe in Truth and Freedom, parted by insincerity. The
vile weed has crept up around us; we are parted by falsehood, even
we. Goodnight. Perhaps I shall not write again. I shall send you a
telegram before I start, on Monday.</p>
<p>Come to me, dear, as soon as you can.</p>

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXVIII.</h3>
<p class="address">February 13th.</p>
<p>Dearest, I have had a strange, wonderful dream. To-morrow
morning, when I awake, I shall find it was not true. Shall I tell
it you?</p>
<p>I handle it as some frail treasure that I fear to touch. I keep
wondering on which side to turn it, so that, when I hold it up, you
may see it shine. The earth is very beautiful to-night; from my
window I see the moon and a mighty host of glittering
worlds,&mdash;even Emilia is beautiful to-night! I went to the
glass just now, to look upon the face of happiness, and, instead of
myself I saw&mdash;Oh, but why say all this? Why not tell you? I
cannot; words are weak, but I think you can feel it, Constance. Oh,
sweetest, I think you can, I think you know. I am half mad
to-night; that is why I write so queerly. But now I will set it
down. I wonder what it looks like, written down. I shall write it
very neatly; it will look pretty. Gabriel loves me. Do you see?
Gabriel loves me. I think I shall write it again,&mdash;Gabriel
loves me. I never wrote anything that pleased me so well, and my
heart sings it within me unceasingly. Oh, of course it is not true;
it is just a dream. I think this is how the dream went.</p>
<p>I sat in the study at the Thatched Cottage; we were all four
there; I had not spoken for a while; the thing I had to say weighed
me down. I said it suddenly, &ldquo;I am going back to Florence; I
shall leave Graysmill on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Norton cried, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; and Jane cried,
&ldquo;Emilia!&rdquo; It was only Gabriel that said nothing.</p>
<p>He sprang up, and looked at me in silence. Thank Heaven, my back
was to the window, for I could not take my eyes away from his. I
thought he grew a little pale; I even thought his lips moved a
little. Then he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; who said that? We cannot spare you. Emilia,
Emilia, you must never leave us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is how the dream goes. I put my head down on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do not want to leave
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence; I sat there bowed, struggling with my
tears; I think I heard footsteps and a closing door. Then a hand
was laid upon my shoulder,&mdash;I knew whose hand it was, and I
shook beneath it.</p>
<p>I only know one thing more that I can tell you. I heard a voice.
It was not a loud voice, but it rang through the darkness; it swept
the world away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia!&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;Emilia, you must not leave
us! Stay with me,&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then some cloud fell upon us.</p>
<p>Good night, dear, good night.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXIX.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">The Thatched Cottage</span>,
February 19th.</p>
<p>Gabriel and I are sitting in the study; we have your letter
before us. These few lines are to thank you, if we can, for your
most precious words. Now nothing fails us.</p>
<p class="signature">Your most loving, grateful,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia Fletcher</span>.</p>
<p class="signature">Your servant,<br />
<span class="sc">Gabriel Norton</span>.</p>
<p>P.S. The blot is Gabriel&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>P.S. 2. In answer to yours. Gabriel is not so inconsistent as
you suppose, nor is Emilia. We have made a provision to which you,
Constance Norris, shall bear witness. Namely this: that, in
accordance with the absolute Sincerity and Truthfulness which we
believe to be not only possible, but necessary to the Conduct of a
Noble Life, we have solemnly promised each other to confess the
truth, should we at any future period&mdash;through altered Love or
other causes&mdash;consider Mutual Life inconsistent with perfect
Honesty.</p>
<p>There! We have worded that beautifully, I think, although
Gabriel insists that &ldquo;Mutual Life&rdquo; is an incorrect
expression. I don&rsquo;t care; it says what I mean. Needless to
add that, in our case, such a prevision is as good as superfluous,
but we feel bound to act up to our principles!</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXX.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, February
19th.</p>
<p>Beloved, we wrote you a few lines together this afternoon, but I
must write again, I alone, to thank you for your letter and tell
you all you ask to know. Yet, indeed, I know not what to tell you.
I am happy; the sun is in my heart. I tried to write to you before,
but the words failed me; besides&mdash;my own self is a stranger to
me. This marvel of marvels, a perfectly happy woman, has nothing in
common with Emilia Fletcher, as you and I have known her.</p>
<p>I believe that Lethe was Joy&rsquo;s well. The past has floated
from me like a bank of mist, I stand flooded in light. And if I
look behind me I see nothing. Two phantoms merely,&mdash;my love
for my mother, my love for you,&mdash;all else is gone. Where are
they now, the clouds that pressed so close upon me? Three words,
and lo! the sky is clear. I have even forgotten what it felt like
to stand there in the gloom with breaking heart.</p>
<p>We have made no plans yet; that is to say, we have made so many
that choice between them is impossible. Still, although we build
fresh castles in the air each time we meet, they all float towards
Italy, in the springtime, halting a while where Constance is. If,
indeed, there be a cloud remaining in my heaven, it is that you
two, my soul&rsquo;s monarchs, know each other only through the
medium of my love. My eyes long to hold you both; I want to walk in
the body, as I do in the spirit, clasping a hand of each.</p>
<p>And to think that she is dead! Shall I tell you something very
strange, almost inconceivable? I cannot help feeling as if she
knew. Surely, Death cannot wholly part a mother from her child.</p>
<p>Good night, my dear little one.</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXXI.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, February
24th.</p>
<p>I showed some parts of your letter to Gabriel, and we laughed
very much. What a bird she is, my Constance! He is ever so much
taller than I. We compared our height with the utmost care, this
morning, for your especial benefit. Do you remember&mdash;what
should I do to you, by the way, if you didn&rsquo;t?&mdash;that
when your head is on my shoulder, my chin just makes a little roof
for your curls, so that you always used to say, &ldquo;How nicely
we <em>fit</em>!&rdquo; Well, there is just about the same
difference between Gabriel and me, as between me and you. I call
that very nice.</p>
<p>Now, as to the rest of the world. My two old dears are very
sweet to me, and to Gabriel also. Indeed, every one is pleasant to
us, and if it does come to my ears that I am looked upon by
Graysmill generally in the light of a harmless lunatic, why, what
of that? I take joy in the thought that none but myself knows the
value of the treasure that is mine. One good soul said to me
yesterday: &ldquo;We think it very nice of you, very nice and
modest. Such a rich young lady as you are, you might have had any
one you pleased!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went on Sunday to pay a formal visit to Uncle George. That
was a terrible ordeal, but we got some fun out of it.</p>
<p>I went to fetch Gabriel, for Uncle George lives just beyond
Miltonhoe. I found him in the study, sitting with his head in his
hands, a picture of misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you dare not be so cruel
as to expect this of me. I cannot go and see your uncle, indeed, I
cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am very good to you on
the whole; this is the only call I expect you to pay, but this one
must be. Up with you, and make yourself look
respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So off he went, with despair in his eye, and Jane and I waited
for him in the kitchen. At the end of half an hour he reappeared.
He had merely put on a horrible black coat; for the rest, I could
see no improvement.</p>
<p>There he stood, without hat or gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imp!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been playing
about! What have you been at all this time? Do you suppose I can
present such a scarecrow to my relations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia,&rdquo; answered the poor dear, very solemnly,
&ldquo;I have washed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to make him fetch the
clothes-brush, and other implements of torture. Jane and I marched
him out into the hall, and there we prepared the victim. We brushed
his clothes, and straightened his necktie. Even Richard Norton was
so excited by the scene that he fetched the blacking-bottle and
polished Gabriel&rsquo;s boots, whilst Jane acted hairdresser and I
held him down by both hands. This in the midst of so much laughter
that the tears stood in our eyes.</p>
<p>When at last we turned him round for inspection, smooth-haired
and stiff with the consciousness of his respectability, I could
have wept at my own handiwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dear!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Oh, Jane,
doesn&rsquo;t he look horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gabriel went into the parlour to look at himself in the
mirror, and declared that he pleased himself mightily.</p>
<p>The visit itself was comparatively uneventful. They have asked
us to dine next Friday, but I doubt whether we shall go. Gabriel
suggests that we should get married at once and fly from such
terrors.</p>
<p>Good-bye now, my sweet one.</p>
<p>Yours more than ever, in spite of all,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXXII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, March 3d.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it comes, but it is a positive effort to
me to write a letter, even to you. If I had not been reminded by
the calendar that a new month is already on the growth, I should
not perhaps have written to-day.</p>
<p>There is nothing to tell you, I am too happy; and how it comes I
know not, but joy is difficult to express. Perhaps because it is so
rare that we have hardly learned its language.</p>
<p>And yet, how soon one gets accustomed to the greatest marvels!
At first, I was filled with doubt and wonder at the miracle that
had transformed me; now, I take it all as a matter of course.
That&rsquo;s the worst of it; a clay-fed mortal is lifted to
Elysium and forgets at the end of a week that he ever tasted
coarser food than ambrosia! I am spoilt for life; if ever any grief
falls upon me in the future, I shall be beaten to earth.</p>
<p>The other night, as I lay in bed, there came to me, for the
first time in my remembrance, that horror of death of which you
sometimes spoke to me. I thought to myself: I shall lie thus in the
dark, only this heart will be still, this blood will be cold, and
there will be no dawn for me,&mdash;yet the world will spin on as
before, and those who loved me will smile again. I feared death for
the first time, because, for the first time, life is dear to me. It
is the outcome of my great content; I cling to my happiness, and
Death is my only enemy, the only power that could knock this cup of
bliss out of my hands. Oh, Constance, to die before one has drunk
that full measure, how horrible!</p>
<p>Another shadow there is that flits from time to time across my
eyes. Why, if such content can be, is it not universal? Why is not
every face I meet stamped with a similar joy? I lay awake long last
night, thinking of you. I do not look upon you as actually unhappy,
that is not in your nature, you sunbeam, yet you lack in your dear
life the best light, that of another&rsquo;s shedding. Now that I
know what it is to be loved, I look upon the blankness of your
existence with dismay.</p>
<p>No more to-day, but I shall write again soon, I promise.</p>
<p class="signature">Yours ever and always,<br />
<span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXXIII.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, March
5th.</p>
<p>Thank you, sweet one, for the eight dear pages. I feel ashamed
of the scrap I sent you the day before yesterday. I never felt so
lazy in my life as I feel now. One thing is certain, happiness is
not altogether good. Blake says somewhere, &ldquo;Damn braces,
bless relaxes.&rdquo; Perhaps he was right.</p>
<p>I am losing myself completely. Every time I part from him I feel
that he has taken yet a little more of me away. He absorbs me,
heart and soul. I do not complain. I feel a little ashamed of
myself from time to time, when I realise how callous I have become
to everything else, when, no matter what book I take down from the
shelf, I find I cannot read half a page connectedly; otherwise I am
perfectly content that it should be so. Impersonal
things&mdash;Nature, Music&mdash;have perhaps strengthened their
hold on me; because they flatter my selfishness, so to speak, they
are always in tune with my heart. Gabriel more than makes up for my
degeneracy; of course that should be, seeing that he has taken unto
himself all my intellectual faculties!</p>
<p>He is writing a simply astounding poem; he reads it to me as it
grows. I tell him he is much more in love with it than with me!
When we are out, he falls into deep dreams; sometimes, when they
are of the kind that words can fetter, he brings them within my
reach, and then we float together into the realms of air.</p>
<p>But, although we are hand in hand, I know that he has sight of
things I cannot see, hears voices I cannot hear; I only clearly see
one vision, him; hear but one voice, my own, that says, I love
you.</p>
<p>Shall I tell you something? I would not tell him for the world;
he would deny it; he would not understand; but you I will tell. It
is this: I love him more than he loves me, and in that thought I
find content. When two love, one must love more than the other, and
blessed is he who loves best. I think that if I felt his love
o&rsquo;ershadowed mine, I should be miserable, I should have some
sensation of unpayable debt. As it stands, he does not know he is
my debtor; only I know it, and I delight in the knowledge. Let him
love me and love me, he will never love me enough; on the other
hand, I yearn so for his love that all he gives me I cherish and am
grateful for; by this means, whether he love me much or little, I
shall always be satisfied.</p>
<p>You must not suppose, because of what I say, that he does not
love me intensely; my love is unmatchable, that is all. He tells me
every day that he could not live without me, and, indeed, it is
true. He relies upon me entirely, calls upon my care incessantly;
and very sweet it is to feel that the supreme God of my Heaven is
as a child in my arms. Ah, I am happy, the world is good, and now
the spring is coming. We rejoice in the growth of the year; Gabriel
longs for the first primrose. He is so hard at work that I think it
unlikely we shall get married before the end of April; the poem is
writing itself at present; it would be a sin to interfere with its
progress. I think, too, that if he can possibly finish it, he will
be able to go away with a greater content upon him, with the
satisfaction that only achievement brings. It is, in fact, very
long since he last completed anything.</p>
<p>And then I shall take him away, I, in his full content, to the
sunshine, to the land of dreams.</p>
<p>There are still some things I can hardly realise.</p>
<p class="signature">Good-bye, dearest.<br />

<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXXIV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, March
20th.</p>
<p>My beloved Constance, I am glad your letter of this morning has
made me a little unhappy; I have been a selfish brute, thinking of
none but myself, and him. I little thought, whilst I lay basking in
the sun, that you stood there shrouded in densest fog. I wish I had
written every day, you poor sweet!</p>
<p>But now I have evolved a plan, and Gabriel thinks with me that
it is a good one. You will find me rather prosaic, yet indeed,
sweetheart, I think you cannot be well; these doleful dumps have
nothing in common with your nature. You are not well, you have no
friend to cheer you, and this melancholy is the result.</p>
<p>Come to us! Gabriel and I are the most undecided beings in
creation; ten days ago he threw up his poem in disgust; there was
nothing for it but to get married at once and start for Italy. A
few days later, inspiration set in, and now he is again so deep in
his verse that we shall stay here until the poem is finished. Come
to us! You will find us excellent company. Yes, dearest, you must
do this; who knows when we may be together again? Besides, there
would be a blank in your knowledge of my life, had you never seen
me in this home, grown dear to me beyond all expectation, through
my great happiness. Besides, I want you and Gabriel to know each
other.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rayner&mdash;if you <em>must</em> bring her&mdash;will find
enough society at Graysmill to keep her busy for a month or two; I
think she would get on splendidly with Uncle George and his
people.</p>
<p>You and I, my darling, will be happy together as of old. I have
told grandmamma and Aunt Caroline that I have invited the pretty
friend whose photographs they admire so much, to come and stay with
me; they ask me to add their importunities to mine.</p>
<p>Come, dearest, and without delay, for your own sake and mine.
Come, and let us be happy together whilst I am still your lover of
old years.</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<p>Answer immediately, will you, Mrs. Norris?</p>
<h3 class="ltrTitle">LETTER XXXV.</h3>
<p class="address"><span class="sc">Graysmill</span>, March
26th.</p>
<p>You are the best friend that ever lived! I am quite restless
with impatience, so is Gabriel, so are my old ones. And who most of
all? Oh! little white face, how I long to hold you in my hands
again, and what warmth of love and happiness I long to pour into
your heart!</p>
<p>I shall not scold you, because you are not well, but what do you
mean by saying that you will come, &ldquo;although of course we
shall never see each other&rdquo;? Dear silly, do you imagine that
I spend the whole day with that creature you pretend to be so
jealous of?</p>
<p>Not a bit of it! Sometimes, just by way of a little salutary
training in renunciation, we don&rsquo;t even meet every day. No,
the bulk of my time will be yours and mine; we will sit up here in
my room, beneath my mother&rsquo;s portrait; we will make the old
days live again, weld the old and the new into one. Then, Gabriel
and I will take you with us for walks fitting a fairy, in the
woods; how you will love them! The trees are misty already with the
promise of leaves, and all manner of sweet things are beginning to
pierce the ground. How we shall spoil you, we two!</p>
<p>So you are coming,&mdash;I can hardly believe it. Never say
again that I shall forget you. Let me remind you, Madam, if all
else fail to convince you, that we two are women, and that there is
one tender love, one yearning, which can only be betwixt woman and
woman.</p>
<p>There is something infinitely pathetic in this truth; a man may
be the dearest, the nearest he can never be.</p>
<p>But I must bless and leave thee. I have promised to meet Gabriel
at the Post-office.</p>
<p>My last letter. No need to write again. Oh, Constantia, can it
be true? Yours in all truth,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="sc">Emilia</span>.</p>
<h2 class="secHead">THE JOURNAL.</h2>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 3d, at evening.</em>&mdash;I am weak,
very weak. I never could carry either joy or trouble pent up in my
heart.</p>
<p>It has seemed sometimes of late that I must be stifled by the
thing that troubles me. Yet it is a trifling thing; nothing, I am
sure, but a foolish, wicked fear, a little disease within myself.
If mamma were here, I should just go and lay my head on her knees,
and tell her everything. Then she would stroke my eyes and bid me
see reason, and all would be well. O my little mother, O great and
dear one, why did you leave your child?</p>
<p>I remembered just now that it used to help me once to write
things down. That is what I must do. I will put it away from me;
perhaps, too, it will look so silly in solemn ink that I shall
laugh at it instead of screaming, as I did just now with my face on
the pillow. And now that it comes to the point, I am ashamed of
saying it. My love is making me mad; was there ever such a fool? I
have been too happy, that is the whole truth&mdash;far too happy.
Poor things, we carry grief well enough, cold grief; but hot joy
cracks the frail vessel.</p>
<p>I have had a wonderful spring, with my two dearests; Constance
sweeter than ever she was, even during her long illness giving some
worth to the hours I might not spend with him, and he ever near.
Then, when we three were together, we were happy, too. How silly of
me to write &ldquo;were&rdquo;; they are still there, the summer
days are long, I love them so well, they hold me so dear.</p>
<p>I have not written it. No matter, I feel better; I already begin
to laugh at myself.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 4th.</em>&mdash;Their eyes met once
at supper, only once, and they did not look at each other when they
said good night. Which means most, to look or not to look? I cannot
read clearly yet. And one can certainly twice ask the same person
to pass the salt without its meaning anything. This is very ugly in
me; my better self is filled with sorrow. Surely it must be in
every one&rsquo;s power to quell the visions of the inmost eye when
they rise sinfully, to close their ears against such whisperings as
now I listen to.</p>
<p>I must fight this. Doubt is Love&rsquo;s murderer.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 6th.</em>&mdash;Constance should not
have said that; there was no need. Why have I come upstairs and
left them together? I am raving mad. And now to cry like a baby! I
have cried every day for five days; this is monstrous! I think that
if some one came and whipped me, I might feel better. This is some
sickness, surely; relaxed nerves, quick blood. I shall write it all
down carefully, calling on what sense I have left to be judge. Of
course the judge will laugh. But first I will wash my face.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Constance said she was not sure she liked him.
Let me remember his first words about her, the day after her
arrival. I brought him into the drawing-room, and put his hand into
hers, saying, &ldquo;Here is your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very shy, and hardly looked at her. &ldquo;We are meeting
under inauspicious circumstances, Mrs. Norris,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;We have heard so much about each other that I, at least,
cannot reconcile the strangeness of your person with the intimate
affection I have so long had for you in my thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> funny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I know what you mean. I thought I knew you quite well, and
you&rsquo;re not at all the sort of person I thought you
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel did not stay long; I went with him to the door when he
left, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is prettier than her photograph. I like her,
Emilia.&rdquo; I was so glad.</p>
<p>Constance soon began to take an interest in him; he amused
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the queerest creature I ever saw,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t set eyes on him without laughing; he is too
comic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she fell ill, poor love! They did not meet for a long time.
And every day, when Gabriel came to fetch me for my walk, he only
asked after her as he should have asked after my dearest friend. Of
course, when she got better and he sat with us daily to help me to
amuse her, they were thrown more together. It was a great joy to me
to see how well they got on.</p>
<p>Then she began to tease him. They never talked very much, for
all that. When I come to think of it, it was early last month that
Constance began to say, &ldquo;How is your friend this
morning?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Gabriel for two
days; I miss him; he makes me laugh.&rdquo; But I did not notice it
then.</p>
<p>What? Is this all I have to say? It is too ridiculous! Of course
she likes him; one cannot come near him without some love. Besides,
she would like him for my sake. It is all so natural. He, too, did
not often speak of her, does not often speak of her. It is natural,
knowing how I love her, that he should feel at ease with my
Constance. Nor could I have wished it to be otherwise.</p>
<p>Now let me think when I was first taken with this mad fit. It
was last Thursday week; we were all three in the wood; it was one
of my bad days, when I love him unto pain; it hurt me that he
lagged behind, I wanted him near. And I twice saw Constance turn to
look after him; I turned, too,&mdash;they smiled at each other.
When he drew up, the path was wider; it was the first time, I
think, that instead of coming to my side, or placing himself
between us, he went round to Constance.</p>
<p>I noticed it, I felt it; there spread a quick pain through my
whole being. It was silly, perhaps, but I walked round behind him,
and slipped my hand through his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you tired, my Emilia?&rdquo; he asked; but I
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear; I only wanted to take your arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said to myself, &ldquo;I am very glad that he is mine, and
not another woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never remember having understood hatred as I did at that
moment; the possibility of his growing to love Constance had not
yet occurred to me, only the thought that he might some day love
another woman better than me. And it dawned upon me thus suddenly
that I was jealous.</p>
<p>And now, what does the judge think? No evidence, of course not;
they are both as true as gold, they both love me dearly, they would
not dream of a flirtation,&mdash;pah! the word sickens me, it is
not fit. And there am I in my folly leaving them together, whilst I
give way to ugly doubts, and tear myself by an ugly passion.</p>
<p>I had better go down again. This doubt of them is hateful in
me.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 10th.</em>&mdash;I must be very
jealous indeed. This is very strange. I dreamed last night that we
were in a room full of people, we three. I was seeking him, and he
came towards me suddenly with Constance on his arm. Lifting her on
high, I threw her far from us, so that with a cry she sank into
great depths; and Gabriel&mdash;seeking to stay me&mdash;caught me
by the waist. I heard the whirl and the hum of those about us, but
in the weakness of my love I fell with my head upon his breast, and
thus we floated into endless space.</p>
<p>I am a sensible person as a rule, yet the flavour of this dream
has been with me all day long, and I could hardly look at Constance
for the wrong I had done her in my thoughts. I must be very
jealous.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 18th.</em>&mdash;I put it from me for
a while. I have been very calm; I have watched them narrowly. I am
very calm now. Gabriel came to spend the evening; Uncle George had
been provided for Mrs. Rayner&rsquo;s edification, and we all sat
together in the drawing-room. Grandmamma and Aunt Caroline had
Constance between them under the lamp. I could watch her very well.
Gabriel sat next me. We could not talk, so I thought we might as
well play backgammon, and we set the board so that he could not see
Constance.</p>
<p>When Gabriel left, I took him as far as the blue door, first
making a round of the garden and shrubbery; it was a dear walk. He
said, &ldquo;Shall we make a match of it, Emilia, between your
perfumed uncle and that benighted woman?&rdquo; It certainly was an
excellent idea. Towards the end he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia, you have been rather pale these last days. Take
care of my girl, my dear girl. And your step is not over firm; you
cling to me as you walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, yes, that was true enough; I was clinging to him with all
my force.</p>
<p>Gabriel is older than he was; he would never have noticed this
when first I knew him, not even when first he loved me. He has
grown much more thoughtful of late.</p>
<p>All this holds together. I am perfectly calm; I am not deceiving
myself. I am calm because I see the need of self-possession and
reflection. Gabriel and Constance,&mdash;it seems horrible to set
it down thus before my poor eyes,&mdash;they love one another.</p>
<p>And now let me be very careful, very just and true. They love
each other, but they do not know it. I know it, because my great
love has so trained my eye that they cannot deceive me; neither he
nor she; themselves, perhaps, but me never.</p>
<p>I do not say that it is dangerous love, lasting love; these
passing fancies die their own death, and therefore I think I shall
not disturb them; if I part them, the shock might awaken them to
the truth. No; I will let their fancy run its own course, trusting
that it may die before they become aware of its existence.</p>
<p>That is it; they do not know it yet, it is an unconscious
attraction. He loves me so firmly, he would never dream of
infidelity to me; yet, just at present, he is unfaithful in thought
and does not know it. Poor dear, if he knew, how miserable he would
be, how he would hate himself! And Constance, too. This is a cruel
thing, but I think I can bear it; it must pass because they love me
so much. It rests with me; I must be very wise. They are as
sleep-walkers; I must lead them from danger, patiently, tenderly. I
think I can keep calm.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 21st.</em>&mdash;It comes to me
almost as a miracle what one can bear. It seems that a certainty,
however terrible, hurts less cruelly than doubt. I suffered most at
the dawning of my fears. Now that I know the worst, I can strain my
endurance to the requisite point. Besides, it cannot last. The more
I think of it, the more natural it seems to me that they should
thus forget themselves, for a while; have I not myself been foolish
over both? The fault, too, is mine; I brought them together; they
are not to blame.</p>
<p>Some day I shall laugh at all this; and it is really endurable,
even now. The thing is to brace oneself sufficiently, to the exact
point. It seems to me I keep saying the same thing over and over
again; but it is so necessary to keep it in mind.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 25th.</em>&mdash;Gabriel is not well.
I noticed it a day or two ago. This afternoon he came to fetch
Constance and me for a walk; it had been so warm that we thought we
would walk after tea. And instead of walking, we stayed in the
garden. Mrs. Rayner&mdash;thank mercy!&mdash;was out driving with
grandmamma and Uncle George.</p>
<p>We stayed in the garden, and idled through the hours; we each
had a book, but I doubt that we read a dozen pages between us. Nor
did we talk much; every now and then we fell to talking, but the
pauses had the best of it.</p>
<p>Gabriel looked very tired; I spread a rug out on the grass, and
he fell asleep with his head on my knees. My pretty Constance said
to me, &ldquo;You will be tired, you have nothing to lean
against,&rdquo; and she brought her chair up behind me so that I
might lean against her. She is very sweet, my Constance. She put
her head down next to mine, and we spoke in whispers, mostly of
him. She has no suspicion that she loves him more than need be. But
it came into my head then, looking down at Gabriel&rsquo;s pale
face, and remembering how he had said he could not sleep of nights,
that perhaps he knows he loves her.</p>
<p>I must watch them more closely. To-morrow I am going to the
Cottage. I fear my visits there a little. Jane is very fond of me;
it is difficult to hide from her that, just at present, I am not so
happy as I was. Gabriel and Constance would, of course, notice it
also, but they are not quite themselves.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 27th.</em>&mdash;I think I feel as
men must who die of thirst adrift in mid-ocean. There is nothing in
creation I could not tell Gabriel and Constance between them, yet I
must now bear the burden of a secret I can share with neither. Some
day, of course, we shall speak of it and laugh. Perhaps not. My
only fear now is that perhaps I might go mad, that perhaps I am
mad, that all this is a deception, the outcome of my poor brain. I
don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>I found Gabriel on the Common just before I reached the Cottage.
I thought he was writing; he was lying at full length on the
heather. I stood still within a few yards of him, and presently he
looked up, his dear face flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I want you more than ever
I did! Sit here by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when I had sat down a little way from him, away from him
just because I so longed to sit next, he drew himself up to me and
took my glad hand.</p>
<p>I asked him what was amiss, saying I did not like his looks and
nervous ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your gay spirits?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
hardly know my child, he has grown so sober.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I hardly know myself. I
think I am not well. The poem is dead,&mdash;not a throb of the
pulse. Emilia! you must cure me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how shall that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me away! I am weary of all things. The summer is
fledged; he will take wing before we realise it. You must marry me
soon, very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I promised that I would,&mdash;on the 15th of July, as we
presently decided.</p>
<p>Surely, if I were not mad, I should be very joyful. I feel no
joy, only disbelief; I cannot believe, sore as I am with doubt and
sorrow, that in nineteen days all will be well, and I again full
mistress of that I fear to lose. Just at first, I was dizzy with
joy, and thought my misgivings had been very vain and foolish; but
then it occurred to me that Gabriel was perhaps impelled to this
sudden decision by the dawning consciousness of his infidelity, and
hoped&mdash;by marrying me at once&mdash;to check the further
growth of his fancy.</p>
<p>If this be so, he is wise; for that it is a passing fancy I am
certain. I should not marry him if I thought otherwise.</p>
<p>But it is very sad; I am so sorry for us all.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>June 30th.</em>&mdash;It must be late; the
chimes have just told three quarters, it must be a quarter to
three. I was in bed,&mdash;I am very much troubled. I think I had
better write a little, lest I lose my self-possession; that would
be fatal. Constance and I returned to-day from London; we had been
there to get my things. I took her with me because I feared to
leave her alone with Gabriel; it seemed unwise. Besides, I could
not leave them; I am indeed intolerably jealous; I never leave them
now for the fraction of a minute. I cannot, it is too cruel pain;
and I am grown such a coward, I cannot bear it.</p>
<p>Yet it was foolish to take her with me; I might have foretold
how it would be. I saw very soon that she pined for him, perhaps as
much as I did. And I knew that he wandered to and fro at home,
meeting her thoughts with his. I brought her back as soon as I
could. Gabriel met us at the station; the engine shrieked, as I did
in my heart. It was a strange mingling of the Heaven of my life
with the sordid greyness of the world. I saw at once that there was
a change; I had parted them and taught them what each was worth to
the other.</p>
<p>So now I know. It is well, perhaps, to have reached the end, the
limit of misery, to know that, come what may, I have suffered my
fill. And I was so happy. I cannot think to-night; I know not what
to do; I stare at my dead joy,&mdash;it is dead and cold, nothing
can wake it now. When I have stared a little longer, I must dig its
grave, bury it in the bare earth, in eternal darkness.</p>
<p>That is all I feel, the death of my joy; I cannot yet think of
them that killed it.</p>
<p>To-night in my despair I cannot tell whether I love or hate
them; love them for what they were, or hate them for what they
are.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 2d.</em>&mdash;The day is hot and
heavy; it suits me very well. Yesterday we were nearly all day
together. I remember how it was with me when my mother died; I had
sooner bear it again than my pain of every day. To be with them,
watching the growth of their terrible love, that is murdering me,
and yet to stay on, fearing a worse agony. Their eyes shall never
meet; I shall stay and watch them, if I die for it.</p>
<p>Only thirteen days more and he is mine, and I can bear him from
her. Yesterday I thought, Shall I give him to her? But I am not
generous. It may be wicked, it may be cruel, but I, too, am living.
Why should I break my heart that theirs may be whole? No; he chose
me for his wife, he will not take his word from me. I know he loves
her better, but he will forget that, I shall make him so happy, I
shall spoil him so! Oh, yes, he will forget. For a year, perhaps,
he will be unhappy; then all will be well.</p>
<p>It might be different if I did not know how happy I can make
him.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 3d.</em>&mdash;Let me write it down,
all my infamy. I am possessed by a new fear,&mdash;that Gabriel
might prove honest. It is not true that trouble chasteneth; there
is no health left in me. If I clear all the cobwebs away, I still
can see the right. I can see this: that he loves her better than
me, and I remember our covenant.</p>
<p>I know that it is my duty to go to him and lay his freedom in
his hands; or, barring this, to await the truth from his own lips.
Yet now, when I am alone with him, I am possessed by this terrible
new fear, that he might be true to his own self and me. For to
marry one woman and love another is a shameful act indeed.</p>
<p>Let me look upon my love and ask myself whereof it is made. If I
seek to have this man, knowing his heart to be another&rsquo;s, if
I desire for him rather the silence of cowardice than the nobler
loyalty of truth, why, then, my love is not good love. It is not
love, but a most unholy passion, that places its desire above the
well-being of its object. And yet I can see the right.</p>
<p>Oh! how empty are these dreams, and how the devil in us, the man
of flesh, mocks the God-led spirit that dreamed them!</p>
<p>The blood of the heart is master. We shall never reach
perfection.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 4th.</em>&mdash;They have not met
to-day. I was at the Cottage, and we made merry as best we could.
Gabriel laughed. But when I went into the larder to fetch the bread
for tea, I stayed and cried; for he had laughed otherwise the first
day I came.</p>
<p>Oh, what have we done, we two! We set up Truth as our God,
believing that we should right all the wrongs of the world by
living clean of heart and hand and tongue. Where are we now?
Falsehood lies thick upon us, blackening each word, each trifling
action. Yes, I went and cried in the larder, and when I got back to
the kitchen Gabriel was playing with the kittens, a very imp as of
old. We laughed, both of us.</p>
<p>But later, when I came upon him unawares, he sat with head bowed
low, and his white hands clasped on his knee. I closed the door
softly and went home. It rained a little.</p>
<p>I knew, I know that I am cruel, yet,&mdash;only one
life,&mdash;and I love him so! Only one life, and he loves her so.
The road is dark; I cannot find my way.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 6th.</em>&mdash;I have been very
sinful. I was worse yesterday, if can be, than before; more blind,
unjust, and selfish. Gabriel came to supper; it had been a hot day,
and in the evening we walked together, we three.</p>
<p>We watched the colours fade from the sky and the blue night
deepen; the little stars came one by one. The wind rose, soft and
cool, and there we stood, we three, under broad Heaven. I fell back
a little, and they went on side by side, silent and still. Not a
word, not a sign, but I knew, I, what peace was upon them, soothing
the turmoil of their blood. There they stood against the
sky,&mdash;how I had watched them, how I knew them,&mdash;oh, my
heart, how I loved them! And it came to me suddenly how hatefully I
had been loving them.</p>
<p>Two women passed us on the road; they spoke of their dead, and
one of them said, &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood still and laughed aloud, so that my dears turned,
wondering. But I have repeated it to myself ever since. The woman
spoke the truth. For, God or no God, there is a Might against which
we cannot stand, and woe be unto those that lift their little wills
against the will of Nature. When two love, they must belong to each
other; when one loves, Miserere.</p>
<p>I will wait a day or two, until I have learned my lesson well,
until I am strong; then I will do what must be done. But I must
first be strong, test my strength to the uttermost, and tell myself
every day, &ldquo;She will be his; she will take the joy that shone
into your eyes; you will have nothing, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I must try to realise that thought and bear it nobly; for
to make a sacrifice and bear it ill is beneath contempt.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 9th.</em>&mdash;How beautiful love
is! Now that, one by one, I am breaking the tendrils from the wall,
and shall soon hold Love in my hand, an emblem merely, clinging to
nothing, I see all that is divine in it. I myself am selfish,
earth-smeared; yet by means of this talisman I am to be heroic,
even I, finding joy in the gift I prepare for others through the
tearing of my heart, the outpouring of my own blood. It is a
blessed madness. Sober, I could not.</p>
<p>To-day one week remains. Gabriel said to me just now, &ldquo;In
a week, Emilia, we shall be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said I; and I wondered at his strength,
at his loyalty to me.</p>
<p>How comes it, I wonder, that it took me so long to find the
small straight path. I must hasten now and be ready soon; he has
suffered all too long. And Constance is thin, her eyes hang
heavily, she helps me prepare my wedding clothes, and is gay, to
hide what she cannot. She often says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How slow you are! Hurry up, my solemn bride, or we shall
never be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready enough,&rdquo; say I.</p>
<p>To-day I went to Mrs. Rayner, and begged her to approach her
solicitor on the question of obtaining Constance&rsquo;s divorce.
My ignorance of these matters is absolute, yet surely this is
possible. Gabriel once led me to believe she could obtain her
divorce without difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a divorce is so scandalous,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rayner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so scandalous,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as what it
may prevent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe my words were entirely thrown away, for her blindness
is phenomenal. She is, besides, much too self-absorbed at present
to properly watch Constance; her horizon is obscured by Uncle
George&rsquo;s whiskers. It gives me, even in these days, a grim
satisfaction to see those two preparing millstones for each
other&rsquo;s necks.</p>
<p>I shall write to Marianna, telling her to expect me in Florence
shortly. How calm I am! Have I learned my lesson so well? Or is
this calm mere self-deceit? When I have truly learned the lesson,
realise that what I am about to do separates me from both forever,
surely I shall not be alive to go to Florence.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 10th.</em>&mdash;To-day Constance
would not come to the Cottage with me, although Jane Norton had
most particularly wished it. I think she avoids Gabriel,&mdash;it
may be my fancy, or perhaps mere chance; otherwise it still seems
to me that she does not know she loves him.</p>
<p>She came up to me in the morning, to help me pack my papers; we
idled, we wandered restlessly about my disordered room. Suddenly
she came to me as I leaned over my strong-box, and, clasping me
round the shoulders, laid her head down on the back of my neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you remember your
birthday at Florence, when I helped you with your books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood up and took her to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I would that day were back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a sigh, a little shiver. I felt it. But she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly, big thing, how can you talk so? You are going to
be so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor little Constance! To-day I may say it, to-day she is still
the poorer. Soon &rsquo;twill be poor Emilia.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 11th.</em>&mdash;To-day they met
again. I am not schooled, I have not learned my lesson, and now I
know that I shall never learn it. We were out together; again I let
them walk ahead, and kept far behind them, saying to myself:
&ldquo;This is my life!&rdquo; But it was unendurable. I rejoined
them, and slipped in between them; I cannot yet look upon them side
by side, neither actually nor in my imagination.</p>
<p>This does not mean that I shall not abide by my decision. Only
three days more; I must hasten. Yet these are the last days I have
to live; mingled with my pain is the last drop of joy I may taste
upon this earth. And yet, having their love, I dare not think of
death.</p>
<p>It dawned upon me to-day that Constance knows; she is pale, and
much troubled. Poor little one.</p>
<p class="spacedTop"><em>July 12th.</em>&mdash;To-morrow it must
be. I meant to tell him to-night, but I could not.</p>
<p>It is half-past ten. Aunt Caroline has just been to my room,
bless her! I thought she was in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you room for this in your trunk, Milly?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I should like you to hang it up in your room wherever
you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a text she had painted for me. Written in gold among
sprays of lilies-of-the-valley shone &ldquo;God is Love.&rdquo;
Poor soul! she ought to know.</p>
<p>Yes, to-morrow I shall tell him. I should have told him
to-night. I stayed at the Cottage until late; after supper he
brought me home. We were very silent. I kept on trying to begin,
wondering how to say it, and he had something, no doubt, in his
thoughts. I knew all the while that it was our last walk across the
heath together; perhaps I wanted to keep it entirely my own. I
walked a step or two behind him, so that my eyes might gaze their
fill, and he did not seem to feel my watching. I wanted to print
his form forever in my memory.</p>
<p>We were in sight of the blue gate; we had not spoken for
half-a-mile, and had fallen very far apart. I turned suddenly
giddy, and spread my hands towards him, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel! Gabriel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very kind to me; he turned back and put his arm about my
waist, and we went on more slowly still, as silent as before. But,
all the while, something within me said: &ldquo;Do you know where
you are? Do you know who holds you? In a few weeks, oh! in one
hour, you would sell your soul for one of these seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet I could not feel; it seems to me now that I did not
feel.</p>
<p>Within a few yards of the blue door we stood still. I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come no further, Gabriel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I held his hand to my side; I knew that I might never do so
again. We stood thus a few seconds, then I turned my face up
suddenly, and he kissed me on the eyes. And then he left me.</p>
<p>Why do I write this? It is merely as a picture before me. I feel
very little now; I am so cold.</p>
<p>And now he walks home across the heath. Good night, Gabriel. Why
did he kiss my eyes? It was better the first time.</p>
<p>All past, all gone, all dead. I cannot see that I need live in
this graveyard.</p>
<p>Perhaps I too shall die; who knows?</p>
<h2 class="secHead">THE POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
<p>There was a man who made unto himself wings, and thought to soar
upon them; but, as he rose into high Heaven, the Sun melted the wax
wherewith he had fastened the pinions on to his body, and the poor
fool, sinking to earth, was drowned in deep waters.</p>
<p>Now, as Icarus fell into the sea, what lesson would have risen
from his heart unto the sons of men?</p>
<p>This?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children of earth, the earthworm crawls in its blindness;
be content, for ye are such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make wings unto yourselves and fly! My wings were strong,
and should have borne me further; I fall and die, yet I have seen
the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spacedTop">I know not. Nor know I how to read the lesson
of my own life. I, too, can only say, &ldquo;My wings were strong,
and should have borne me further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shall not burn my letters and my journal, as I meant to do.
Here they lie in my lap; I meant to burn them to-night. But now,
after reading them through, I think that I shall tie them together
and lay them by, adding a record of that which came to pass.</p>
<p>When I am dead, some human being may read my words, some other
pilgrim on the narrow way, seeing where I faltered and fell, may be
able to step onward with the greater firmness. And yet, I doubt it;
there were no need to weep over our faults, might they but save
another&rsquo;s tears. Man learns all truth through his own
pain.</p>
<p>I married him. It was a great sin.</p>
<p>It would be easier to sit in judgment on oneself, did straight
and simple purpose lead to a single act. My purpose was clear
enough; I meant to give him his liberty, I knew that it was my duty
to do so, but the blood of the heart was master.</p>
<p>Had I been physically strong at the time, had not many weeks of
doubt and misery affected me bodily as well as mentally, I might
perhaps have had the strength to fulfil my intentions. I say
perhaps; we cannot tell what might have been. And it is
particularly in such cases as mine, when body and spirit are alike
affected, that we are the most easily thrown out of balance by
unforeseen influences, by some sudden wave of feeling, by the mood
of another, by the interference of time and place.</p>
<p>The day after I made the last entry in my journal, I did not see
Gabriel until the evening. Constance had a headache, my poor sweet,
and wished to be alone; so I, too, was alone nearly all day. And
all day long I rehearsed the scene to come, gathering all my
strength together, telling him in my imagination what I had to
tell, in twenty different ways. When evening came, my heart was
dead. I felt absolutely nothing. I remember singing as I made
myself tidy for supper, and being so offended with myself for doing
so that I left off, in order to simulate, at least, a depression I
no longer felt.</p>
<p>Gabriel supped with us, and we were exceedingly merry; not that
I was necessarily merry, not being sad,&mdash;indeed, I was neither
the one nor the other, but my heart was dead, and I let my body do
as it would. I remember looking hard at Gabriel once, and saying to
myself, &ldquo;After all, he will admire me for this much more than
I deserve; after all, I do not love him so much as I
imagined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper I played some while on the piano. Gabriel and
Constance sat very far apart, but I should not have felt it had
they sat together. At ten o&rsquo;clock I left off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall turn you out a
little earlier than usual to-night, because I want to walk as far
as the park with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, for a second, feeling returned to me; there came a little
flutter of fear within me, the same I sometimes felt in childhood
when I had told a lie and, wanting to confess it, stood at my
mother&rsquo;s door saying, &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no moon, but the sky was not dark. We walked through
the garden in silence; once or twice I contrived to force up to my
lips, by great effort, the words I meant to speak; but then my
heart beat so fearfully that I felt my courage fail me, and I said
to myself, time after time, &ldquo;Presently will do.&rdquo; It was
not active love for Gabriel that checked me, merely the actual
physical fear that I suppose most people experience when about to
give forth words of great import.</p>
<p>But just as we reached the shrubbery, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel, I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;something to tell
you. But you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was for one moment a great relief to think that he was about
to save me from the trial I dreaded.</p>
<p>We took a few more steps in silence; I was looking down, not at
him. I felt my heart beat more than ever, fear was still there, but
of a different kind; I awaited his words as one might await a
death-blow. But they did not come. Suddenly he halted, and I,
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said I, and I lifted my head.</p>
<p>There he stood, smiling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember &lsquo;Peer Gynt&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked he.
&ldquo;That was the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the laurel, and then at him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that was the
bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dear eyes were gazing into mine; I could not look away
again. There came a tremor over all my body; my love for him swept
over me in throbbing waves of pain; I fell towards him, stifling a
cry against his breast. And he, wrapping his arms about me,
strained me to him with great force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I love you very much; I
have never told you how much I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew it to be the last cry of his conscience, but, as I lay
there listening to the beat of his heart, there fled from me what
little yet remained of my conquered spirit&rsquo;s strength and
noble purpose. Only the woman in me cried aloud, &ldquo;I
cannot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to speak, but the words came almost as a sob. Quickly I
threw my arms about his neck and, bending his face towards me,
kissed him of my own accord as he smiled; then, breaking from him,
would have run homewards.</p>
<p>But he held me by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I come to-morrow?&rdquo; asked he,
hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Go, Gabriel! God help
me; I love you too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we did not meet next day, and the next we were
married.</p>
<p class="spacedTop">For many months I made believe that we were
happy. Ah! it was not all make-belief! I have had great joys.</p>
<p>Never was the game of happiness easier to play at than it was
for Gabriel and me in the first year of our marriage. He was very
much attached to me, and I loved him.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had been out of England; the sights he
saw filled him with rapture and insatiable curiosity, to appease
which I led him from place to place until I had shown him all I
knew, and still we went onwards, covering new ground together.</p>
<p>We never stayed very long in the same spot; a certain weariness
crept over me at times, but I saw that it was best for him to keep
continually on the wing; and indeed, having no desire on earth but
his happiness, I was ready, for his sake, to wander my whole life
away. Moreover, as he was not working at all the while, I looked
forward to a day when inspiration might set in, together with
satiety, when he too might yearn, as I did, to sit in peace beside
a hearth of his own.</p>
<p>Constance wrote to us occasionally, and I to her. Her letters to
me were the same as of old, full of love and sweetness; she nearly
always mentioned Gabriel, but not in such a way as to denote
preoccupation. My letters to her were not as they had been; I felt
this at the time. On rereading them just now I burned them
all,&mdash;there was no breath in them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rayner had taken Fairview, the nearest house to
Fletcher&rsquo;s Hall, soon after my marriage, and set her cap at
Uncle George with so much persistence that he engaged himself to
her the following summer. So my sweet girl stayed on at Graysmill.
Grandmamma&rsquo;s letters, and Aunt Caroline&rsquo;s, were always
full of her, of the comfort her sunny presence brought them; my
father-in-law and Jane had the same tale to tell.</p>
<p>For many months I never even contemplated the possibility of
returning to England with my husband. There is no knowing how long
our wanderings might have been, but for my illness. Gabriel and I
were passing through Pisa at the end of June, on our way to Lerici,
whither we were bent on pilgrimage, when I fell ill.</p>
<p>That was the end of many dreams. The wheel could turn no more;
the swift and restless life of day to day, that fled the past and
hung back from the morrow, was checked abruptly, completely.</p>
<p>But, lying in that little bed of painted wood, staring at the
net curtains and green shutters, at the lozenge pattern on the
wall, at the cornucopi&aelig; on the ceiling, a clear and sober
sight returned to me. The body having failed, the spirit found its
strength.</p>
<p>Our sudden halt had worked swiftly on Gabriel also. He set to
work; the restlessness died out of him, but, alas! the lightness,
too. He became very still, silent and self-absorbed. In the cool of
evening, the time of day when I was strongest, I used to turn my
kind little nun out of the room, and then Gabriel came and read to
me.</p>
<p>At first he had tried to finish the long poem begun in the days
of our betrothal, but he soon laid that aside, and another sprang
forward with extraordinary rapidity. Perhaps he himself was hardly
aware of the sorrow of that poem; perhaps he thought I would judge
it so entirely as a work of art that I should not take note of its
deep gloom, of its hopeless melancholy. But nothing was lost upon
me now. I read it in every line,&mdash;he suffered; something
failed him,&mdash;perhaps he knew not what, perhaps he knew. A
terrible loneliness was in his heart,&mdash;and I had given him all
I had to give.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of July, I awoke with a sense of something
fresh and sweet; a bunch of roses lay upon my pillow, and Gabriel
stood beside my bed. The shutters were still closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have you been out already?
How dear of you this is! Is the sun shining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, what should it do but shine on our
wedding-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he sat down on the edge of the bed, and took both my hands
in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have made me very
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I, sitting up, bent my head low over his hands and kissed
them; my loose hair fell forward, he did not see the tears that
stood in my eyes. I knew that he had lied.</p>
<p>From that day I began to think with a purpose. I had already
gained sufficient mastery over myself, sufficient calm and strength
of spirit to be able to do so.</p>
<p>I can hardly call it a struggle that followed. I copied out and
laid under my pillow the words of the covenant we had made the day
after our betrothal; daily I read it through, and recognised how we
had failed towards each other, and towards our best beliefs.</p>
<p>We had both failed; but, whereas he had erred merely, I knew
that I had sinned; in the fulness of my remorse, my only thought
was now to offer reparation. Nor was it only for Gabriel&rsquo;s
sake that I was now possessed by the desire of atonement. In the
blindness of human passion, I had sinned against my better self, my
noblest purposes, my most firm and high beliefs; that passion
conquered, I determined to make amends for my great transgression
by following, regardless of pain and danger, the highest path that
lay within the range of my vision, regardless of pain to myself,
regardless of that fear of the world which so often leads us to
accept its canons, even in sight of a nobler righteousness.</p>
<p>Therefore I resolved to set him free; I believed this to be
possible, although my sight was clear, my spirit calm. But he who
beholds only the aerial pathway of an ideal right may stumble and
fall on the stones of the world. It was only given me later to
realise, through grief too terrible for words, that, given the
world as the world is, there are wrongs that are irrevocable, lies
that, once lied, no truth can ever wipe away.</p>
<p class="spacedTop">Meanwhile, health returned to me. We stayed at
Pisa until I was convalescent, then moved to the sea. His poem and
my thoughts occupied us severally; they were good and peaceful
days. Now and again the heart rebelled against the severity of the
spirit, but, take it all in all, a great calm was upon me.</p>
<p>One evening in September, Gabriel and I were leaning out of my
window; it was almost dark; the occasional footfall of a passenger
fell on the stones of our quiet street; some men were singing in
the trattoria round the corner; we two leant there in silence,
counting the stars as they came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have had a letter from
Constance. I am afraid she is not very happy at Graysmill; her
mother worries her; she sounds lonely and not over well. Shall we
go home a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel shifted his feet, and turned the latch of the shutter
round and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I think not;&rdquo; I mean,
if you feel you want to see Constance, go, Emilia, only don&rsquo;t
leave me too long. I had rather stay here. I have been thinking it
over of late, and I see no reason why I should ever return to
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dearest one,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that. I long to see him, and Jane, too.
You go home, Emilia, and bring them back with you. We four can live
out here in Italy forever, live and die here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Constance?&rdquo; said I, then.</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The latch of the shutter whirled round
and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Constance,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s
hard on Constance. She will have to live with her mother and your
step-uncle, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I should never allow that.
But we can arrange about Constance when we see her; we can talk it
over together. I cannot go without you, Gabriel. There is no reason
why we should stay there long,&mdash;only come with me you
must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out for some days, but in the end I conquered. We passed
through Florence on the way, and there beside my mother&rsquo;s
grave I put forth the first, the only prayer I ever made,&mdash;a
wordless yearning towards the Inconceivable, a prayer for strength
and the Light of Truth.</p>
<p class="spacedTop">We reached Graysmill on the nineteenth of
September. My impatience was so great that, in spite of
Gabriel&rsquo;s displeasure at what he called my rashness, I would
not stay in London on the way, but we travelled straight down,
reaching Fletcher&rsquo;s Hall at midnight.</p>
<p>Aunt Caroline was down to receive us, for I had sent a telegram
from Dover; upstairs, my dear old woman was sitting up in bed with
sweet, wrinkled smiles beneath her frilled night-cap. I was very
glad to be home again; my heart felt warm.</p>
<p>I sent Aunt Caroline to bed, much against her will, and then
Gabriel and I sat down to drink the tea he had wished for, beside
the fire in the breakfast-room. Gabriel was very white, his eyes
shone all too brightly; again and again I saw him put his hand to
his brow, a trick he had when he was nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t drink so much
tea; it&rsquo;s very bad for you, you will never sleep
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am sure I couldn&rsquo;t
sleep anyway. I think I shan&rsquo;t stay here, Emilia, if you
don&rsquo;t mind. I feel very impatient to see my father; the night
is fine, I shall walk over to the Cottage, and take him by
surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was just looking at him, wondering how to meet this mood, when
there came a light tap at the window, a French window that opened
on to the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>We listened; again it came, again; and then a little voice
calling, &ldquo;Emilia! Emilia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Constance!&rdquo; I cried, and, springing to my
feet, I flung open curtain and shutter and window.</p>
<p>There she stood in the dark, with the light of the room upon
her. She was in black, with a dark shawl wrapped round her head; I
could see nothing clearly save the white, outstretched hands, the
pale sweet face, with its halo of burnished curls.</p>
<p>She sprang towards me with a little sob, and we laughed and
cried together as I clasped her to me, covering her beloved face
with kisses. I was still holding her fast when she perceived
Gabriel; from the stronghold of my arms, with her head still
resting on my bosom, she turned towards him and held out her hand.
I looked neither at him nor at her, but, bending away, laid my
cheek upon her curls.</p>
<p>And it was thus they met again.</p>
<p>Of the days that immediately followed, there is not much to
tell. Any doubt I might have entertained as to the continuance of
their mutual passion vanished swiftly and entirely. The path of
duty lay very clear before me.</p>
<p>I saw more of Constance than of Gabriel in those days; we were
almost always together, and he avoided us. Richard Norton, who had
greatly aged in the year of our absence, was so happy in his son
that Gabriel had every excuse for spending the greater part of his
time at the Cottage. Indeed, he usually left me directly after
breakfast, and did not return until supper-time.</p>
<p>He wrote a great deal, out in the woods and in his old room. The
poem was approaching completion, and this, in fact, was the reason
why for fifteen days I deferred the execution of my purpose.</p>
<p>The sufferings we all three experienced daily at this time, when
it was impossible to entirely avoid each other&rsquo;s presence,
were endurable to me, and I sought to help Constance to bear them.
To him they were, so to speak, a source of inspiration; and I
therefore determined to let things run their course until the last
line should be written.</p>
<p>On the fourth of October,&mdash;it was Saturday,&mdash;I, having
a headache, did not get up to breakfast, and Gabriel left before
nine o&rsquo;clock for the Thatched Cottage. My sweet Constance
spent the entire morning with me. She had brought a hat to trim,
but the work did not proceed. It was a black felt hat, I remember,
and I trimmed it for her. She herself was in one of her childlike
moods, winsome and gay atop of the sorrow that had made her pale
cheek paler, and set blue rings about her dear eyes.</p>
<p>I was alone all the afternoon, and copied out for the last time
a letter to my husband, on which I had lately expended many hours.
I felt strong and sure of myself; it was not cowardice that led me
to write to him instead of saying to his face all that I had to
say. But there was no telling in what mood I should find him, were
I to speak. He might refuse to listen; he might move me to
momentary indecision by manner, look, or words; I preferred to
write it all down clearly, to make sure that what I had to say
would not run the risk of being left unsaid through the
interposition of unforeseen and incalculable emotions.</p>
<p>At the approach of supper-time, I dressed and went into the
drawing-room. We were expecting Constance and Mrs. Rayner, the
vicar, and Uncle George. My old dears and I had half an hour to
ourselves before any of them came. Gabriel was very late; our last
guest had already arrived when I heard him come in and rush up to
our room.</p>
<p>When he came down, he was pale in the extreme, and his eyes
danced in his head. I went up to him and drew him aside, towards
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said I, softly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed and took my hands, pressing them nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finished!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I have done,
Emilia,&mdash;the last line is written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up at him with gladness in my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must read it me this evening,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>There came a flash of light before my inward eye,&mdash;the joy
of his achievement,&mdash;then it fell in broken showers, all fell.
I had a sense as of sinking into space, and all was dark within
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and give your arm to Aunt Caroline,&rdquo; said I,
pressing his hand as I let it go.</p>
<p>I myself went into supper with the vicar. We did not sit long at
table. Uncle George, Mrs. Rayner, and Mr. Dobb sat down immediately
after to a rubber of whist with Aunt Caroline; grandmamma fell
asleep. I turned the lamp-shade towards her face, and my pretty
Constance covered her well with a shawl; then, taking my dear one
by the waist, I walked with her to where Gabriel stood at the
chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had an inspiration,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Come, we
will slip away to Fairview and spend the evening alone, we three;
then Gabriel can read us the last canto,&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had already read the first part of the poem to Constance, with
his permission.</p>
<p>Neither of them uttered a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;Constance and I will set off
at once, our things are in the hall. Run up and fetch your
manuscript, Gabriel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my foot through the flounce of my petticoat on the way, so
Constance took me up to her room for a needle and cotton. When we
came down again, Gabriel was in the morning-room; he had drawn up
the blind and was watching the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call this very nice,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Our party is
the better of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance lighted the lamp, and we sat down, all three, at the
table,&mdash;Gabriel with his back to the window, Constance
opposite him, and I between them, to the right of the table.</p>
<p>Then he began to read.</p>
<p>How it went with them I know not, but I was soon entirely lost
in what I heard. With my head upon my arm I listened, the visions
that he conjured filled my eyes, the music of his words engrossed
my ears; more beautiful in form and purpose than anything he yet
had written, this last canto filled me with joy and pride.</p>
<p>When the last words fell, I did not raise my head from the
table. Heaven knows why, but I did not want to let them see, not
even them, that the tears were gushing from my eyes.</p>
<p>I heard Gabriel collect his papers and put them into his pocket;
still none of us spoke. It seemed time to break the silence. I
lifted my head and looked up at my poet.</p>
<p>There he sat with head thrown back and quivering lips; his eyes,
wide with mingled fear and yearning, were fixed upon Constance,
whose white, uplifted face was as the mirror of his own. It was for
an instant only; the next, they turned to me.</p>
<p>And so the tale was told; we sat there, we three, blenched and
panic-stricken, gazing into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The time had come. I rose, took their hands, and laid them
together on the table. I would have said something, but no words
came; so, smiling simply into the face of each, I bent and kissed
the intertwining fingers, then left the room. I groped my way into
the garden, and, standing on a flower-bed beneath the window,
looked in upon them. They sat as I had left them, with clasped
hands and mingled gaze. I think it was Constance that moved first,
I am not sure, but they rose suddenly and fell into each
other&rsquo;s arms. For an instant I looked upon them with a
strange sense of exultation, as if, perhaps, I were the Spirit of
Love, and not a jealous woman. But when he turned back her white
face with his hand and bent over her, all the woman in me returned.
I saw her little hands clutch him convulsively, she gave a low
cry,&mdash;and then I slipped from the window on to the ground.</p>
<p>How long I crouched there I cannot tell; I felt as one must feel
that has been buried for dead and awakes in the grave. There was
mignonette beside me, and a clump of southern wood. It was the
sound of some one bounding down the steps that roused me. Gabriel
had left her. I got up and shook my clothes, walking to and fro on
the lawn. When at length I thought of going home, I remembered that
I had left my things in Constance&rsquo;s room, and that it might
seem strange in me to arrive at the house bareheaded. So I went
upstairs. The passage was not quite dark; I could just see that
Constance lay outside her bedroom door. I stooped and tried to
raise her, but she flung herself to my knees, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia!&mdash;O my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;come into the room. Hush! the
servants might hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I drew her in and would have laid her on her bed; but again
she fell down and clasped my knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;dear, you loved me so, and
this is what I have done. Oh, Emilia, forgive me!&mdash;Emilia,
forgive me, oh, forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her that she was forgiven. I cooled her forehead with
water, and at length laid her upon the bed. She clung to me
piteously as I was leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me good night,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>I had not felt that I could kiss her, but I stooped and touched
her slightly on the brow, at the root of the curls. Then I left
her, feeling all the way the clutch of her little fingers on my
arm.</p>
<p class="spacedTop">As I slipped up to my room, I had to pass the
drawing-room door; it was ajar, and I caught a glimpse of them all
as they sat at the card-table under the green-shaded lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honours divided, Miss Seymour, honours divided,&rdquo;
said the vicar; and as I slowly made my way upstairs I heard the
clatter of teacups and Mrs. Rayner&rsquo;s thin laugh.</p>
<p>I went past the room I had shared with Gabriel, and made my way
to the topmost floor, to the room that was formerly mine. It was in
disorder, and nearly bare. I lighted a candle, but the sight of the
dreariness oppressed me; I therefore blew it out again, and leant
out of the open window.</p>
<p>It was a cool night, and dark, for clouds had hidden the moon;
the chimes rang the quarters; they seemed to follow close upon each
other, and still I stood at the window. I heard Mrs. Rayner go, and
her escort, Uncle George, return. &ldquo;B-rrr,&rdquo; he went, as
he stamped up the steps. &ldquo;How his keys jingle,&rdquo; thought
I; &ldquo;and is it so cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot remember that I thought much of what had happened; my
senses were very keen, but emotion was torpid. I took note of every
barking dog, every distant wheel; sometimes I sang a little to
myself, and, all the while, I worked my foot to and fro along the
skirting.</p>
<p>Presently Uncle George left for good, taking the vicar with him.
The servants came to bed, giggling under their breath; then all was
still.</p>
<p>I did not leave the window, but in the silence&mdash;there being
now no sound to arrest my attention, save the chimes which I forgot
to hear&mdash;a change came over me. I fell into a sort of dream;
scene after scene the past rose before me in bright visions; then
came the present, chaos. I stood, as it were, in the centre of
nothingness, alone and lost, not a sound, not a light, not a finger
to touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matter,&rdquo; thought I,&mdash;&ldquo;what matter
if I live or die? Surely it is in this state that people kill
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard the chimes again, and a duck quacked in the pond; it was
as the laugh of a devil.</p>
<p>I turned from the window and stumbled over something; I lighted
a candle, and sat shivering on the shrouded bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;it is very
cold. What shall I do? Shall I sleep or die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as it were with a flash, there came to me the thought that
perhaps I was not the only one who sat at this moment coldly
contemplating death. An awful fear seized me that perhaps he,
Gabriel, might be driven to the haven of despairers.</p>
<p>I threw on my cloak, and, carrying my shoes, slowly and
breathlessly crept down the stairs to the back door, which had a
light fastening. And I ran across garden and park, across Graysmill
Heath in the night, strengthened by one fear against all others,
nor did I stop until I stood on the little hillock within sight of
the Thatched Cottage.</p>
<p>I saw at once that a light was burning in the window of
Gabriel&rsquo;s old room. I sprang on and halted once more on the
grass-patch before the Cottage door. The blind was down, a shadow
passed to and fro. I could see very well by the way he moved that
he was not calm. I wanted to get to him. I tried the house door,
but it was firmly fastened. I sat down on the ground and kept my
eyes fixed on the window. He stooped repeatedly; once, as he swept
the hair back from his eyes, I thought I saw that he held something
in his hand. I picked up a stone, ready to throw it at the window,
but my courage failed me; then I noticed that the light flickered
strangely, as from fire; it faded, and all was dark.</p>
<p>I strained my ears in vain for a sound; a horrible fear seized
me. I flung my little stone, but it was very dark; I heard it
strike the bricks. Groping for more, I flung another, and yet
another. One of them struck the panes; I stood and held my
breath,&mdash;no sound.</p>
<p>I made my way to the door again, tried it again; I laid my ear
to the key-hole, and then I distinctly heard the creaking of the
stairs; some one was coming down. The hall was crossed, the bolt of
the door was gently drawn. I fell back a little; some one came out
with a firm step, and sprang on to the path.</p>
<p>It was a mere shadow that I could see; I caught him by the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started violently, and something fell from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why are you here? Emilia!
you have come too soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember that I clutched his wrists, as if in fear that he
might even then lift his hand against himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coward!&rdquo; was all I said; &ldquo;oh, you
coward!&rdquo; He did not answer me, and we stood so a while. Then
he said gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hands are cold, my girl; let us go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made our way into the study. After some groping, we found the
matches and lighted a candle. Gabriel sat down by the table and
buried his face in his hands. I went to him and stroked his
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I guessed how it would
be; that&rsquo;s why I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I have done
you a fearful wrong; there was only one atonement I could make, and
that you have prevented. Emilia, leave me. You should not have
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forget how I told him; but I told him then how, in joining
their hands together, I had meant them to understand that I
resigned him to her. I told him how long I had known of their most
natural love, confessed my struggles, my defeat, and acknowledged
to the full the sin I had committed in marrying him in spite of
what I knew. I reminded him, too, of our covenant, of the beliefs
and aspirations we had shared, and implored him to accept his
liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know little of the laws,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but if
they refuse to part us, why, we must part ourselves. If human
justice is so far removed from righteousness, why, we must rise
above it, and never mind the world. &lsquo;Tis a wide place. Take
her and make her happy where none knows. The worst of my pain is
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gabriel still insisted on the necessity of his death.
&ldquo;Your dreams are wild!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
but one way. I have robbed you of all you had, of husband and
friend. If I die, you, at least, have reparation. I have thought it
well over; I am as calm as you. My poems lie in ashes in the grate.
My life is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked very long, very quietly, until the dawn peeped through
the cracks of the shutters. And at last he gave me his word that he
would live.</p>
<p>Having this promise, I rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is morning,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we are not fit to
talk further. To-morrow we must seek our way. Go, Gabriel, and try
to sleep; I will go upstairs to Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we crossed the hall, he ran out into the garden, and I
followed him. It was very cold, and I shivered, chilled by the dawn
of a hopeless day.</p>
<p>He stooped on the path before me, and picked up the revolver he
had dropped, looking at me with a queer smile. But the thought that
he might even then be lying lifeless was brought to my mind with
sickening vividness. I reeled, and would have fallen, had he not
caught me in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a fool,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I saw you dead among
the leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took my hands and kissed them, murmuring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia&mdash;dear Emilia!&rdquo; And then I made my way
up the creaking stairs, and roused poor Jane, who lay asleep with
her head under the bed-clothes. I told her there had been some
trouble she should know of to-morrow, and, being half asleep, she
did not question me, but made room for me in her bed.</p>
<p>I must have fallen asleep towards rising-time, for I did not
hear her get up; but when she was nearly dressed I awoke and got up
also, begging her to excuse my explanations yet a little, as I was
very tired.</p>
<p>Gabriel got down at the same time as I did. Richard Norton was
always a lie-abed, so poor Jane was alone to puzzle out the secret
of our haggard faces. It was not early; it must have been nearly
ten o&rsquo;clock when Aunt Caroline arrived. The poor thing burst
into tears when she saw me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Mercy!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;oh, what a fright
we&rsquo;ve had! Why must you go out so early in the morning,
before the house is up, and no message, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made some little joke to laugh it off; Gabriel laughed also;
we offered her some breakfast, and it was then that she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go back at once; I promised Mrs. Rayner to bring
back Constance immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel and I were standing side by side; we looked at each
other, and he must have read the same sudden fear in my eye that I
read in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>We left Aunt Caroline at the Cottage, and drove together in all
haste, and in perfect silence, to Fairview.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rayner was at breakfast when we entered the dining-room; I
can see her still, with her egg-spoon in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are fine people!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but please
remember another time that Constance is not such a horse as you
are, and can&rsquo;t stand exercise on an empty stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared stupidly, and then I said, but my voice was so low that
I scarcely heard it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not seen Constance this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rayner gave a shrill scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;where is my
child!&rdquo; and ran from the room. Gabriel and I stood motionless
where she had left us, and clasped our cold hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia Fletcher!&rdquo; called Mrs. Rayner from upstairs,
with a hard ring in her voice, &ldquo;come up; I want you a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I went up. The bed was tumbled, but she had not slept in it;
her hat and cloak were gone. I sat on the edge of the bed and shook
from head to foot; Mrs. Rayner was running to and fro like a mad
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gone! Where is she gone? I never said good night
to her!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;Mrs. Norton, you saw her last,
you must know something of it. Here are her boots, she must have
gone out in her shoes; the soles were thin, she&rsquo;ll catch her
death of cold!&rdquo; And she ran to the door, crying,
&ldquo;Constance! Constance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made my way to the dressing-table; I remembered to have seen
her purse upon it when I went up to mend my dress the evening
before. It was gone, but in its place I found a little note with my
name upon it.</p>
<p>I ran with it to Gabriel; I could not read it alone. &ldquo;A
letter,&rdquo; was all I said, and we read it in the bay-window,
standing side by side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Emilia, dearest, you have given me so much, and now I
have sinned against you. You forgave me with your lips just now;
forgive me with your heart when I am dead. You must not blame me
for what I do, you know I was always very weak; I cannot look you
in the eyes again, nor him. God will forgive me, I think. Good-bye.
Be happy,&mdash;neither you nor he must grieve for me; it is a poor
little life that I throw away, and all the good I ever knew came
from you or him. Be happy&mdash;Emilia, my old Emilia,
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was found towards evening, many miles from Miltonhoe, on the
banks of the Avon. Gabriel and I had been up and down the land all
day, following her traces.</p>
<p>When we heard that she was found, we parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drolls from Shadowland,&rsquo; by J.H. Pearce, is

really superior art. The &lsquo;Drolls&rsquo; are short, abrupt,

bitter; brief, but not slight; subtle, but not obscure in their
hidden meanings, the &lsquo;Drolls&rsquo; suggest nothing in

Their mysterious poetry brings them nearer to Brentano and

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
